**Role-Playing Game**, or more commonly by the acronym **RPG**, combines the concept of theater with the rules of a game, where players take on the roles of fictional characters they control.

In theater, actors memorize their script and portray fictional characters, following a predefined storyline set by the author. In a game, players make decisions constrained by rules to overcome challenges, outdo opponents, and win. When the best elements of these two worlds are combined, we get an RPG.

An RPG session essentially involves a group of people, where one person takes on the role of the "Game Master", while the others are the players. To enhance the session, it’s recommended to use rulebooks from a preferred system, as without rules, the Game Master may struggle to convince players of the story’s direction.

Before the session begins, the Game Master guides the players, following the rules of the chosen system, to fill out their **character sheets**. These contain essential information such as strength, endurance, intelligence, personality details, skills, and more. Once all players have their characters ready, the Game Master provides an introduction to the adventure, setting the stage for what has happened so far and giving the players a basic objective to kick off the adventure.

As events unfold, the Game Master describes the story, and the players imagine the scenes. When a character needs to take action, the player tells the Game Master what they intend to do. The feasibility of this action is assessed based on the character’s sheet, and then dice are rolled. Depending on the result, the action succeeds or fails.

Dice are a fundamental part of an RPG, and they’re not limited to the traditional six-sided die. There’s a variety of dice, some rarer and used only in specific systems, identified by the letter "D" followed by the number of sides. For example, an eight-sided die is called a **D8**, and a twelve-sided die is a **D12**.

To avoid limiting the number of characters to the number of players, it’s common for the Game Master to control multiple characters, known as **NPCs** (Non-Player Characters). These NPCs enrich the story by providing useful information to the players’ characters or acting as adversaries to challenge them.

Each RPG session is a unique experience. The Game Master cannot fully control the story, as the players’ decisions in response to challenges are unpredictable. After significant events, the Game Master awards **experience points** to the characters, allowing them to improve their attributes, making the game even more engaging.

## HOW DO YOU WIN IT?

In an RPG, there’s no "winning" in the traditional sense. This concept can be tricky for newcomers to grasp, but a good RPG session isn’t about competition. Typically, players unite for a common goal, facing adversaries controlled by the Game Master, known as **NPCs**.

It’s important to clarify that the Game Master isn’t against the players just because they control antagonistic NPCs. If a Game Master wants to end the game, they could create an insurmountable situation that even the strongest, most experienced player couldn’t escape, and… game over. A skilled Game Master balances challenge and fun.

When players and the Game Master have limited time, they may drastically simplify the rules and barely develop a story. In these faster-paced games, it’s common for the Game Master to pit characters against each other, ending the session quickly when someone wins the battle. Some traditional players frown upon this “mode,” as it sacrifices much of the essence of role-playing and fantasy.

## THE CHARACTERS

In this system, the players’ characters are the stars of the adventures, just like the heroes of the anime. As a player, you will create a character using the rules in this book. Your character could be a fierce ninja from the icy wilderness or a sharp-witted shinobi with lightning-fast reflexes and an even faster blade. You might portray a deadly ninja trained in wilderness survival techniques or a shinobi who has mastered the elements. As your character embarks on more adventures, they gain experience and grow more powerful.

## YOUR ROLE
As a player, you will use this book to create and role-play a character. Your character is a shinobi, part of a team regularly hired to undertake missions and face enemies. The gaming session should take place in a comfortable setting with enough space for books, character sheets, dice rolls, and any other necessary materials.

The Game Master creates and describes each scene, narrating the action. Your role as a player is to decide your character’s preferences, personality, relationships with other characters, and to act out those choices. You might play a stern shinobi, a cheerful one, a reckless ninja, or a cautious one. With your character in mind, react to each situation as it unfolds. Sometimes combat will be necessary, but other situations may be resolved with stealth, negotiation, or using appropriate skills.

Consider and plan your character’s reactions. You can describe your character’s actions (“Naruto approaches the entrance and attacks the opponent”) or speak as your character (“I sneak toward that passage and strike the opponent with a powerful attack”). Either approach is valid, and you can switch between them depending on the situation. Be creative, bold, and true to your character… but above all, have fun!
