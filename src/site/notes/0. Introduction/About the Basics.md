Like other games, it has rules that serve as guidelines for imagination and event interpretation within the game. These rules help determine how events unfold in the story and resolve conflicts or obstacles faced by the players’ characters.

This section provides a summary of the game’s basic rules. However, reading the entire **Test System** and **Combat** chapters is highly recommended, especially if you are the Game Master.

## BASIC MECHANICS: DICE TESTS

There's a core mechanic for actions during the game: dice rolling. Whenever a character attempts an action with a chance of failure, they must perform a test as follows:

- Roll **2 eight-sided dice (2d8)** and add their results.
- Add the **accuracy** of the test (equal to the value of the attribute, skill, or ability used in the action) along with any applicable bonuses.
- Compare the total to the test’s **Difficulty Class** (abbreviated as **DC**).

If the total equals or exceeds the Difficulty Class (set by the Game Master based on the situation), the action succeeds. If it’s lower, the action fails.

**Performing a Test:**
**2d8 + Accuracy** vs. **Difficulty or Another Test**

In some cases (especially in combat), instead of comparing to a difficulty, the character’s result is compared to another character’s test result. The higher result wins. In case of a tie, the character with the higher **accuracy** wins. If the tie persists, the test is rerolled.

Rolling a **15 or 16** on the dice is always a **Success**, regardless of the difficulty. Similarly, rolling a **2 or 3** is always a **Failure**, no matter the character’s accuracy.

This mechanic forms the basis of tests in this game. For more details, see the **Test System**.

## THE GAME MASTER

In game, one player takes on the role of the **Game Master**. Their responsibilities include narrating the story, creating and directing scenes, role-playing villains and other non-player characters (NPCs), and arbitrating situations using the book’s rules. The Game Master should have a thorough understanding of the rules, particularly the **Test System** and **Combat**.

While it’s a demanding role, it’s highly rewarding, as it involves creating and shaping the game’s world, its characters, and guiding players in developing their characters within an exciting story. For more details, see the **The Game Master and the Game**.

## PLAYER CHARACTERS

The other players create unique characters, ninjas who serve as the protagonists of the story. They can be heroes, villains, or young shinobi still finding their path.

Characters are created using the rules in this book. For complete rules and details on how to create your character, see **Character Rules**, located in **2. Mechanics**. You can start at [[2. Mechanics/Character Rules/1. - Campaign Level\|1. - Campaign Level]], and follow the order.
