Each Hidden Village has its own symbol, tied to a natural element, and is governed by the strongest ninja, who holds the title of **Kage**. One of the most prominent is **Konohagakure no Sato**, the Hidden Leaf Village, located in the Land of Fire. Konoha is one of the largest and most powerful hidden villages, led by the **Hokage**, and is the home of Naruto.

Other significant villages include:

- **Sunagakure no Sato**, the Hidden Sand Village, in the Land of Wind;
- **Kirigakure no Sato**, the Hidden Mist Village, in the Land of Water;
- **Iwagakure no Sato**, the Hidden Stone Village, in the Land of Earth;
- **Kumogakure no Sato**, the Hidden Cloud Village, in the Land of Lightning.

The villages’ income comes from missions undertaken by their ninjas. Not all residents are ninjas, but they are all connected to this activity in some way—some teach young ninjas, others craft weapons and equipment, and some provide essential goods and services (after all, even ninjas need to eat!). Others are doctors, sages, or scholars.

In this world, being a ninja is an honorable and respected profession, governed by a strict code of conduct. The greatest and most famous ninjas were heroes who helped many people and completed critical missions for their countries. There are some outcasts, rogue ninjas who sell their services to the highest bidder, but a true ninja is recognized for their nobility and character.

## CULTURE

The world of Naruto is a fictional reality where people of different nationalities coexist. However, everyone speaks the same language, resulting in a somewhat universalized culture with slight variations in customs.

Compared to our world, the Naruto universe blends modern Eastern and contemporary Western elements, with rare medieval influences. Cities have sewer systems, electricity distribution, radios, and other basic amenities similar to our modern world. However, long-distance communication (like satellites) does not exist, and mail still relies on pigeons and hawks. In a shinobi society, this is no hindrance, as various animals can be trained in shinobi arts, becoming exceptional for their species and serving their trained purposes.

Clothing varies from early 20th-century Japanese styles to modern, exotic outfits. There’s a noticeable difference between the attire of ordinary people and shinobi. As military figures, shinobi wear battle-adapted clothing, often adorned with unique ornaments and symbols reflecting their rank in the hierarchy. Clothing also varies by region—colder climates, coastal areas, or port cities have distinct styles. Additionally, prominent individuals in larger cities often wear formal, expensive attire like suits or traditional Japanese garments.

Most people are literate and free to pursue their desires. There are no known cases of government-sanctioned slavery, though illegal instances may occur. Social disparities are evident, as in any modern society.

## POLITICS

The world is politically divided into countries, each with its own economic, military, and governmental activities. Influential countries are ruled by a **Daimyo** (Feudal Lord). Smaller, less influential countries are governed by a ruler, often subservient to larger neighboring nations. Daimyos typically pass their title through inheritance. In some cases, a country may be conquered, and its ruler appointed by the conquering nation’s Daimyo (if the conquered land isn’t formally annexed). Internally, countries operate under a feudal system, with mayors managing regions, all answerable to the Daimyo. Feuds contain cities where free people and workers live under their country’s protection.

Internal commerce within countries is constant and diverse. The feudal structure does not restrict trade. Externally, countries only trade with those they have good-neighbor pacts with, preventing illegal activities and avoiding conflicts that could lead to war.

## MILITARY POWER

The great countries are known for their strong military autonomy, entrusting their best warriors and greatest secrets to their Hidden Shinobi Villages. Each major country has one Hidden Village where shinobi are trained to answer their nation’s call in times of war.

However, Hidden Villages don’t always work directly for their country, as they have autonomy to undertake missions for their own sustenance, even in other nations. Successful missions increase a village’s fame and prestige, as well as that of its country, deterring potential aggressors through fear of their military might.

Still, Hidden Villages are subject to the will of their country’s ruler and must not undertake missions against their nation. Often, villages face great dangers to survive or protect their country, even without informing the ruler.

Hidden Villages are so-called because they are well-fortified and isolated, though this doesn’t prevent trade or travelers from arriving. Entry requires a visa and a request at a guard post. Unauthorized entrants or non-residents are barred, and invaders are considered threats, hunted by local shinobi, and likely captured or killed. Each village has its own traditions and rules, but this entry protocol is universal.

## TERRITORY

The Naruto world has five major nations, each named after a natural element, housing the most influential Hidden Shinobi Villages. Smaller countries and independent islands surround them, often named after elements or natural phenomena (e.g., Rain or Grass) or even food and drink (e.g., Land of Tea or Rice).

The **Five Great Shinobi Nations** are:

- **Land of Water (Kirigakure no Sato – Hidden Mist Village)**: The smallest of the five, its territory spans an archipelago of islands in the east. Its fragmented geography led to frequent civil wars, resulting in many deaths and the destruction of clans. Fear of **Kekkei Genkai** users led to a brutal purge of clans with these abilities, causing some bloodlines to be lost forever. The largest central island hosts the country’s government and likely the Hidden Mist Village, led by the **Mizukage**. The village has produced powerful shinobi and assassins, including the legendary **Seven Swordsmen of the Mist**, who wield unique and formidable blades. The country’s alliances are unclear, as its pride and unique practices make alliances rare.

- **Land of Fire (Konohagakure no Sato – Hidden Leaf Village)**: Not the largest but the most powerful and influential nation, located centrally with vast territory and a coastline. A key trade route, it’s surrounded by various countries and covered in dense forests. It seeks alliances with nations like the Lands of Wind, Grass, Rain, and Waterfall. **Konoha**, led by the **Hokage**, is one of the world’s most powerful villages, founded about 60 years ago with a history of triumphs and struggles. The **Nine-Tails (Kyuubi)** once attacked Konoha, causing massive destruction. The Fourth Hokage sacrificed himself to seal the demon into a newborn, **Uzumaki Naruto**, saving the village. Konoha has since lived in peace and controls one of the tailed beasts.

- **Land of Earth (Iwagakure no Sato – Hidden Stone Village)**: One of the largest nations, though less explored in the story. Its mountainous terrain and significant influence place it near the Land of Fire. It is led by the **Tsuchikage**.

- **Land of Lightning (Kumogakure no Sato – Hidden Cloud Village)**: A large northern nation separated from the Land of Fire by two smaller countries. Its snowy, cold climate persists year-round. The **Hidden Cloud Village**, led by the **Raikage**, is a major shinobi village. Years before Naruto’s story, Konoha and the Cloud were at war. A peace treaty was signed, but a failed attempt by a Cloud shinobi to kidnap a member of Konoha’s **Hyuuga Clan** led to tensions. The Cloud demanded the life of the Hyuuga responsible for killing the kidnapper, causing controversy and straining relations within the Hyuuga Clan and between the villages.

- **Land of Wind (Sunagakure no Sato – Hidden Sand Village)**: Believed to be the largest of the Five Great Nations, its defining feature is its vast desert landscape. The country has historically been distrustful, avoiding alliances in earlier times, a trait reflected in its Hidden Village. While the Land of Wind possesses considerable wealth, its harsh climate and terrain prevent widespread prosperity for all its inhabitants. The Hidden Sand Village is led by the **Kazekage**. However, the village and its leaders have a bloody and mysterious past. It is known that Sunagakure attempted to control one of the tailed beasts, the **Bijuu**. Additionally, mysteries surround the disappearance of the Third Kazekage. The village is renowned for its formidable defenses and is one of the most inaccessible among the Hidden Villages.
