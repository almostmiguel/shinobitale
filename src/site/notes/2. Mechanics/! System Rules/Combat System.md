Clashing blades, projectiles cutting through the air, and fireballs turning bodies to ash—these are the thrilling beats of battle. Any RPG adventure is full of combat situations—and sometimes, there’s no other way out! Whether the characters must escape an ambush on a desolate road or fight their way out of an enemy hideout, the rules in this chapter provide an exciting way to resolve any of these situations.

---

## **SCENES, ROUNDS, AND TURNS**

A **combat scene** is a part of the adventure or mission in which characters clash, fighting for their lives and ideals.  
Combat takes place over a series of **rounds**, during which each character gets a **turn** (their chance to act in the round). In other words:

- A **scene** is made of **rounds**,
    
- Each **round** is made of **turns**.  
    The order of turns is determined by each character’s **initiative**.  
    Each round lasts approximately **six seconds**.
    

Combat unfolds as follows:

1. Every combatant starts the battle **unaware**, unless they are already aware of their enemies.
    
2. The GM (Game Master) determines which characters are aware of their enemies.
    
    - If **some**, but not all, combatants are aware of their enemies, a **surprise round** takes place.
        
    - Those who are aware roll **Initiative** and, in Initiative order (from highest to lowest), may take **one Standard or Movement action** (not both).
        
    - Unaware combatants do **not act** during the surprise round.
        
    - If **everyone** or **no one** is surprised, skip the surprise round.
        
3. Remaining combatants now roll Initiative. All are now ready for the **first normal round**.
    
4. Combatants take their turns in **Initiative order**, using their normal action allowance.
    
5. Once everyone has taken a turn, the **round ends**.
    
    - A new round begins, with all characters acting again in the same Initiative order.
        

---

### **TURN AND ROUND TRACKING**

Unless otherwise stated, durations longer than a single turn or round are counted **by the affected character’s turns**, whether it’s a benefit or penalty.  
For example:

- If a technique grants the **user** +1 to rolls for 2 turns, it lasts **through their current and next turn**.
    
- If a technique gives a **target** -1 to rolls for 2 turns, it lasts **through the target’s current and next turn**.
    

The concept of a **scene** also applies to non-combat moments, such as dialogues with important NPCs.  
Many abilities and powers can only be used **a limited number of times per scene**, or last **until the scene ends**.

---

## **INITIATIVE**

Each round, every combatant can act. Initiative checks determine the **order** in which they act, from highest to lowest.

### **INITIATIVE CHECKS**

At the beginning of combat, each combatant rolls an **Initiative Check**.

- The GM rolls for NPCs.
    
- Each player rolls for their own character.
    

**Initiative = 1 die + Dexterity + Notice**

The GM ranks the characters from highest to lowest total.  
Each character acts on their turn, and the **same Initiative result** is used for the entire battle.

- If two combatants have the **same Initiative total**, the one with the **higher Accuracy** acts first.
    
- If still tied, they both roll a die; the higher result goes first.
    

If something **modifies a character’s Initiative** (e.g. the **Haste** condition gives +2), the Initiative **order may change**, but **a new roll is not made**.

#### **ENEMY INITIATIVE**

Normally, the GM rolls Initiative **once for all enemies**.  
This gives:

- Each player one turn per round.
    
- The GM one turn for the enemy group.
    

However, the GM may roll **separate Initiatives** for different enemy groups—for example, a separate roll for the enemy leader and another for weaker minions.

#### **JOINING A FIGHT MID-COMBAT**

If a character enters combat after it has already started, they must **roll Initiative** and **act on their turn** in the next round.

---

## **SURPRISE**

When combat begins:

- If **you are unaware of your enemies**, but **they know about you**, you are **surprised**.
    
- If **you know of them**, but **they don’t know of you**, then **they are surprised by you**.
    

### **DETERMING SURPRISE**

Sometimes, everyone on one side is aware; sometimes, no one is; sometimes only some are. Sometimes a few on each side are aware while others are not.  
The GM determines awareness at the start of the battle and may call for **Notice check**, or other rolls, to determine if a character detects the enemy.

### **THE SURPRISE ROUND**

If **some but not all** combatants are aware of enemies, a **Surprise Round** occurs before normal rounds.

- Combatants who are **aware** roll Initiative.
    
- In order, they can take **one Standard or one Movement action** (not both).
    
- Combatants who are unaware **do not act** and are considered **flat-footed**.
    

If **no one** or **everyone** is surprised, skip the Surprise Round.

---

## **ACTIONS IN COMBAT**

During combat, there are **four main types of actions**:

- **Standard Action**: Attack an enemy, or use a technique/power against them; maintaining concentration effects also counts. Any action that might harm an enemy and doesn’t have a specific rule is considered a **Standard Action**.
    
- **Movement Action**: Move around the battlefield, or use a technique/power on yourself.
    
- **Partial Action**: Quick actions, such as sustaining an ongoing effect or using defensive techniques.
    
- **Free Action**: Small, quick, or interpretative actions, like speaking. You can take **infinite different Free Actions**, but **you can’t repeat the same Free Action** multiple times.
    

In addition, there are:

- **Reactions**
    
- **Full-Round Actions**
    

### **REACTIONS**

When an enemy targets you (e.g., with an attack or technique), you may take a **Reaction** to defend.  
Examples include:

- Dodging
    
- Anticipating
    
- Blocking
    
- Making an Intelligence check to resist mental control.
    

Like Free Actions, Reactions are **unlimited**, but you can’t use **the same reaction more than once per attack**.  
(You can’t block the same attack twice, but you can block one and dodge another.)

### **FULL-ROUND ACTION**

These involve covering long distances or using complex/powerful techniques.  
Using a Full-Round Action consumes both your **Standard** and **Movement** actions at once.

---

### **PER TURN, YOU MAY MAKE**:

- **1 Standard Action**
    
- **1 Movement Action**  
    **or**
    
- **1 Full-Round Action**
    

And also:

- **1 Partial Action**
    
- **Unlimited Free Actions & Reactions** (with restrictions above)
    

---

### **RECEIVING AND USING ACTIONS**

You gain your actions at the **start of each round**, but can only use them on **your turn**,  
**unless** a defensive move or technique allows otherwise (like **Evasion** or **Kawarimi no Jutsu**).

Once you use an action (e.g., attack or skill check), it is **spent**, even if the attempt fails.

- Throwing projectiles or striking an enemy is a **Standard Action**.
    
- Jutsus and powers have their own casting times described individually—they may range from **Free** to **Full-Round** actions.


### **EXCHANGING ACTIONS**

Actions have a **hierarchy**:

- **Standard > Movement > Partial**
    

You may **downgrade** actions freely:

- Trade a **Standard Action** for a **Movement** or **Partial**.
    
- But you **cannot trade upward**.
    

You can only exchange actions on **your turn** or during a **defensive maneuver**.


### **DELAYING ACTIONS**

You may **hold an action** to use later in the round. This is common for **Predictive Maneuvers**.

- You cannot carry over held actions to the next round.
    
- If you held an action but didn’t use it, the GM may allow you to use it at the **end of the round**.

---

## **ATTACKING AND DEFENDING**

Combat checks follow the general system rules.

### **ATTACKING**

To attack an opponent, you use either **Melee Combat (MC)** or **Ranged Combat (RC)**, depending on the type of attack.  
To hit, the attacker rolls **2 dice** and adds their **Accuracy** value.

The **type and difficulty** of the check depends on how the **target chooses to defend**.  
There are four basic types of defense:

- **Dodge**,
    
- **Block**,
    
- **Anticipate**,
    
- **Defend with Technique**.
    

---

### **DODGE**

**Dodging** is a **reaction** where you use agility and speed to avoid the attack.  
Dodge sets a **Difficulty Class** that the attacker must beat, following the “check against difficulty” rules.

- The attacker's difficulty becomes:  
    **9 + the defender’s Dodge Accuracy**.
    

Dodge can reach the **highest numerical defense values**, especially when boosted by techniques or abilities.  
However, **you lose all Dodge bonuses** if you are **flat-footed** or **unable to move**.

---

### **BLOCK**

**Blocking** is a **reaction** where you try to parry or deflect the attack with a weapon or shield, using your **Melee Combat (MC)** skill.

- Roll a **contested check**: both attacker and defender roll **2d8 + MC Accuracy**.
    
- If the defender’s result is higher, the block is successful, following the “check vs. check” rules.
    

**Block** can be used against **melee attacks** and **projectiles**.

To block, you **must be holding something** capable of realistically deflecting the attack (e.g., a sword to block a projectile or another sword).

You may also block **projectile-type techniques** (like effects with **Cannon** or **Arrows**) **if** you're using a weapon capable of doing so, such as:

- A **special weapon** (e.g., _Adamantine Staff_), or
    
- A weapon enhanced with **Energize** effects.
    

**You cannot block attacks from enemies that are two or more size categories larger** than you.  
Trying to block heavy weapons with light/medium ones applies **-1 Accuracy** to your roll.  
Blocking while **unarmed** is **not allowed**, even with gauntlets.  
**Attempting an invalid defense** results in the attacker gaining an **automatic success**.

---

### **ANTICIPATE**

**Anticipating** is a **reaction** where you try to predict the enemy’s move to evade the attack, using your **Anticipate Movement** skill.

- Roll a **contested check**: both attacker and defender roll **2d8 + Anticipate Movement Accuracy (AM)**.
    
- If the defender rolls higher, the defense is successful.
    


---

### **DEFENDING WITH A TECHNIQUE**

Using a **technique to defend** is more complex.  
It **consumes chakra** and usually requires a **Partial**, **Movement**, or even **Standard action**, depending on the technique's rules.

If the target chooses to defend with a technique, they must make a **contested check** against the attack:

- Roll **2d8 + Read Movement Accuracy (RM)**.
    
- If the result is higher than the attack, the technique is executed in time and the target gains its effects.
    

**Every defensive technique** requires an Anticipate Movement check unless stated otherwise in its description.

---

### **Example:**

Someone throws a kunai at you. You can:

1. **Dodge** (reaction, no roll; attacker’s difficulty is **9 + your Dodge Accuracy**);
    
2. **Block**, if armed (reaction, MC check);
    
3. **Anticipate** the attack (reaction, AM check);
    
4. **Use a defensive technique**, like forming a barrier (Movement action, AM check).
    

---

### **BASE DAMAGE**

A successful offensive action deals damage, which varies depending on the type of attack.

- If it’s a **melee attack**, whether armed or unarmed, it deals **base damage** equal to **half your Strength (rounded up)** plus the **weapon's damage**:
    

**Melee Base Damage**  
`(Strength ÷ 2) + (Weapon Damage)`

**Example:**  
If a character attacks in melee with a **kunai** (weapon damage +1) and has Strength 3, the base damage is:  
`Str 3 ÷ 2 + Weapon 1 = 1.5 + 1 = 3 Base Damage`  
(Rounded up)

- If it’s a **ranged armed attack**, the same formula applies, but **Dexterity** replaces Strength:
    

**Ranged Base Damage**  
`(Dexterity ÷ 2) + (Weapon Damage)`

---

### **WEAPON DAMAGE STACKING**

**Weapon damage is not cumulative**.  
If you’re using multiple effects or abilities that give weapon damage to unarmed strikes (like **Iron Fist**, **Stone Skin**, or **Juuken**), their bonuses **do not stack** and are **incompatible**—only one can be used at a time.

However, **some weapons or abilities** (like **throwing weapons** or the **Two-Weapon Fighting** trait) allow stacking weapon damage.  
Follow the rules written in their descriptions.

If a **melee attack has its own custom damage formula** (such as the **Kyoudo Kyouka** ability), **do not use the general formula**.  
These techniques and their damage **do not stack** unless their descriptions say otherwise (e.g., **Kyoudo Kyouka** cannot be used together with **Juuken**).

---

### **NINPOU AND ELEMENTAL POWERS**

If the attack is a **power**, it deals damage as per its specific rules.

For **Ninpou** and elemental techniques (**Doton, Fuuton, Katon, Raiton, Suiton**), the standard base damage is:

**Standard Ninpou/Elemental Base Damage**  
`(Spirit ÷ 2) + (Power Level used)`

Even though this is the default, some Ninpou and elemental effects have their **own damage rules**.

**Any damage increases or reductions** (like bonuses from **Powerful Strike** or **Katon’s elemental damage bonus**) are applied **after** calculating **base damage**.

The **minimum base damage is zero**, even if you have many penalties to Strength/Dexterity.

---

## **DAMAGE GRADES**

Combat damage has **grades**, from 1 to 4, determined by the **attack roll result**.  
The **final damage** is the **base damage multiplied** by the **damage grade**.

**Final Damage** = Base Damage × Damage Degree

| 2d8 Result | Damage Degree | Result Description                                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2–3        | ---           | **Critical Failure** – A disastrous attack. You trip, drop your weapon, or hit an ally... |
| 4–8        | 1st Degree    | A poor hit. Even if it connects, it barely scratches.                                     |
| 9–11       | 2nd Degree    | A decent strike. It leaves light cuts or surface burns.                                   |
| 12–14      | 3rd Degree    | A strong blow. A swollen bruise, a deep cut...                                            |
| 15–16      | 4th Degree    | **Critical Hit** – A deep, vital wound causing bleeding.                                  |
**Example 1:** A character uses a power with base damage 5 and rolss 2d8 = [4,8] = 12 → **Damage Degree 3.**
**Final Damage** = 5 * 3 = **15**

**Example 2**: A character hits with a kunai (base damage 4) and gets Degree 3 →  
**Final Damage** = 4 × 3 = **12**

	This damage is subtracted directly from the target's Hit Points.

Some techniques may include **fixed damage** (e.g. fall damage from the Throw feat).
**Fixed damage is not multiplied** by degree. Add it **after** the multiplication.
Unless otherwise stated, all damage is **base damage**, not fixed.

	In contested checks (like MC vs. AM), if you re-roll to break a tie, the final roll determines the damage degree.

If a character gets **Automatic Success** or a **Dice Simulation**, they must still roll 2d8 to determine the **damage degree**. The minimum possible result is Damage Degree 1.

---

### CRITICAL HIT

If your attack roll is **15 or 16**, it’s a **Critical Hit**:
- The target **cannot defend**.
- The attack deals **maximum damage** (Degree 4).

Some weapons or techniques have **expanded critical ranges**, such as the **Scimitar**, which crits on 14 or 16. In those cases:
- Rolls of 14 or 16 = **Degree 4**
- Rolls of 12 or 13 = **Degree 3** (unchanged)

Every time you score a **Critical Hit**, the enemy suffers **bleeding**, if it was **lethal damage**.
Multiple critical hits can **stack bleeding** effects.

---

## HIT POINTS: INJURY & DEATH

Hit Points measure your general resistance to damage.

**Hit Points Formula**  
`10 + (3 × Vigor) + (5 × Campaign Level)`

Track your current Hit Points on your character sheet or separate paper. Subtract any received damage from your current Hit Points.

---

### LOSING HP

Damage can leave scars, dent your armor, or stain your clothes with blood, but it **does not affect your ability to act**—until your Hit Points hit **zero**.

- **If you take damage equal to or greater than your current Hit Points**, your HP turns to **0** and you become **defenseless and out of combat**.  
    Any further damage will push your HP into **negative values**.
    

#### HP THRESHOLDS:

| HP Value     | Condition                                                                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0            | You’re out of combat, defenseless, and unable to act—but still **conscious**.                 |
| -1 to -10    | You’re **unconscious**.                                                                       |
| -11 to -20   | You’re **dying** (unconscious and bleeding out, losing 2 Vitality per turn until stabilized). |
| -21 or lower | You’re **dead**.                                                                              |

To **stabilize** a dying character:

- Make a **Vigor check** (Difficulty 18, Reaction) or
    
- Use a **Medicine check** (Difficulty 16, Standard Action)  
    

If your HP is restored to **1 or more**, you **regain consciousness** and may act again.

**Resurrection** is possible, but only through rare or **forbidden techniques**. Usually, it's easier to create a new character.

---

## HEALING

After taking damage, you can recover Hit Points **naturally**, by **resting**, or with **healing techniques**.

#### NATURAL HEALING:

- **One full night of rest (8 hours)** restores:  
    `10 + (2 × Vigor)` Hit Points
    

> Example: A character with Vigor 6 recovers `10 + 12 = 22` Hit Points per night.

> Any **major interruption** (like combat) prevents healing for that night.

**Optional Rule**: Divide your total night healing by 8 to allow partial healing per hour of sleep.

When you sleep, you also recover from **Fatigued** and **Exhausted** conditions—unless those effects have a fixed duration.


#### HEALING TECHNIQUES:

Certain **abilities**, **techniques**, and **special items** can restore Hit Points. Their effects are described in their respective descriptions.

**Healing Limit**:  
You **cannot heal beyond your maximum Hit Points**. Even healing techniques cannot restore Hit Points past your full total.

---

### **LETHAL AND NON-LETHAL DAMAGE**

Almost all damage caused under normal conditions (weapons, traps, attack techniques...) is **lethal**.

**Non-lethal damage** works like lethal damage but does not count toward determining when you die. For example, if you suffer enough non-lethal damage to bring your Hit Points to 0 or below, you will fall unconscious. However, even if that non-lethal damage takes your HP to a negative number, **you won’t die**.

Normally, weapons deal **lethal** damage. You can use a weapon to deal **non-lethal** damage — by striking with the blunt side, pulling your punches, or avoiding vital spots — but you suffer a **-3 penalty to attack accuracy**.

**Unarmed attacks** and certain specific weapons deal **non-lethal** damage. You may use an unarmed strike or a non-lethal weapon to cause **lethal damage**, but you suffer the same **-3 attack accuracy penalty**.

Some techniques and feats (such as _Iron Fist_) allow an attack that would normally deal non-lethal damage to instead deal **lethal** damage.

---

## **CHAKRA: EXPENDITURE AND RECOVERY**

**Chakra** is the energy source used by your character to activate powers and techniques. It is calculated using the **Spirit** attribute:

**Chakra = 10 + (3 × Spirit)**

Whenever you use a technique, feat, or power that costs Chakra, subtract its cost from your total Chakra points.

#### **OUT OF CHAKRA:**

When your Chakra reaches **0**, you become **exhausted** until you recover at least 1 point.

---

#### **RECOVERING CHAKRA:**

- **Full rest:** After a full night’s sleep (at least 8 hours of uninterrupted rest), you recover:  
    **5 Chakra + (2 × Spirit)**  
    For example, a character with Spirit 4 would recover **13 Chakra**.
    
- **Interrupted rest (e.g., by combat)** prevents this recovery.
    

---

### **SOLDIER PILLS:**

These are special pills with powerful stimulants and nutrients that accelerate Chakra production. Grabbing and ingesting one or more pills is a **partial action**.

- Each pill restores **Chakra equal to half your Spirit**.
    
- **After 1 hour**, the character becomes **Fatigued** until they rest.
    
- **Taking more than one pill:**
    
    - 2 pills: **Exhausted**
        
    - 3 pills: **Unconscious**
        
- **More than 3 pills:**
    
    - No extra Chakra is gained
        
    - The user becomes **immediately unconscious for 1 hour**
        
    - Then **Exhausted for 20 days**
        
        - This exhaustion can be halved with **Medical treatment** (requires **Medicine 10**).
            

> Soldier Pills have **no effect** on **clones** or **non-human creatures**.

---

### **CHAKRA BELOW ZERO:**

When a character's Chakra reaches **zero**, it means they can no longer draw Chakra naturally. However, their body still **contains** Chakra (since all living beings have it).

If a character already has **0 Chakra** and suffers **forced Chakra drainage** (like from _Kikaichū_ insects), they **die** if the amount drained is **equal to or greater than half of their natural Chakra pool**.

**Example:** If your natural Chakra pool is 40, and you are already at 0, then losing **20 or more** Chakra due to forced drain **kills you**.

---
## **COMBAT MANEUVERS**

This section explains combat maneuvers characters can perform, such as attacking with a weapon, using a technique or power, or grappling a target.


### COMMON MANEUVERS

#### **SNEAK ATTACK**  
When you succeed on a Stealth check against an enemy, you can perform a sneak attack against them, which can be ranged or melee. The target of a sneak attack is considered **unaware**.

As long as there is sufficient camouflage or cover in the combat area, you can use your Stealth multiple times, hiding in different positions for new sneak attacks.

At the end of your turn after performing the sneak attack (whether successful or not), if you are still not fully visible, the enemy gets to make a Notice check against your Stealth check, as a reaction, to approximate your position.

---

#### **OPPORTUNITY ATTACK**  
Sometimes in combat you do something that distracts you and leaves you vulnerable. Nearby enemies can take advantage and attack.

- **Performing an opportunity attack:** You may make an opportunity attack when an opponent tries to leave your melee reach. It is a melee attack made as a free action that interrupts the enemy’s movement just before they leave. You cannot perform special maneuvers or use maneuver feats in an opportunity attack.
    
- You can only make **1 opportunity attack per round** and are not required to make one if you don’t want to.
    
- You do **not** suffer opportunity attacks when teleporting or when being forcibly moved (e.g., pushed away by an explosion). Nor do you suffer one if the enemy is prone, paralyzed, or otherwise unable to attack.
    
- **Avoiding opportunity attacks:** You can avoid opportunity attacks from one or more enemies by performing a **Safe Step**, using the **Retreat** maneuver, or the Acrobatics skill. These only apply to opportunity attacks triggered by trying to leave melee range, not by powers or feats.
    
- **Safe Step:** You can use your movement action to step 1 meter in any direction, moving away from an enemy without provoking opportunity attacks.
    
- **Retreat:** Requires a full action. You can move away from an enemy using your normal movement without provoking opportunity attacks.
    
- **Defending an opportunity attack:** Only basic defensive reactions (Dodge, Anticipate, and Block) are allowed against opportunity attacks. Allies cannot intervene to protect you in this case.
    

---

#### **DELAY INITIATIVE**  
As a free action, you may voluntarily reduce your Initiative for the rest of the round, acting later in the order. When your new (lower) Initiative count comes up, you act normally.

You may specify the new Initiative value or wait until some point to act and fix your Initiative at that moment. Delaying is useful to see what allies or enemies do before deciding your own action.

---

#### **MOVEMENT**  
The simplest movement action involves moving up to your character’s displacement distance. When you perform this kind of action during your turn, you cannot perform a Safe Step (1m step).

- Each character may move a maximum distance per movement action equal to  
    **10 + (½ × Dexterity level)** meters (rounded up).
    
- Swimming or climbing reduces this distance to ¼ of the total.
    
- Crawling reduces distance to ½ of the total.
    
- You may convert a standard action into a movement action if needed.
    
- **Movement limit:** You cannot move more than once per round. If you moved on your turn, you must wait until your next turn to move again. This limit applies to all voluntary movement, including Safe Step and teleportation techniques.
    
- However, you may split your movement into parts using the **Moving Assault** feat. You can also increase your total movement distance by succeeding on an Athletics check to perform a Run maneuver.
    
- If your movement is interrupted by an enemy (e.g., suffering an opportunity attack), it does not count against this limit.
    

---

#### **SHOOTING**  
With a standard action, you fire a projectile with a ranged weapon like a bow or crossbow. All shooting checks use the Ranged Combat (RC) level as accuracy, even if you are in melee range with the target.

- Shooting while having an enemy in melee range imposes a –3 accuracy penalty.
	
- Reloading a ranged weapon requires a partial action. See the Draw Weapon maneuver for details.
	
- Simple weapons can be handled by any character without buying feats. See the Weapon Table for which are simple, common, and special weapons.
	
- To attack with a martial ranged weapon, the character needs proficiency (buy the Weapon Training feat). Otherwise, a –3 penalty applies.

---

#### **FEINT**  
Using a standard action, you attempt to confuse an enemy. Make a Dexterity check against the target’s Notice. On success, the opponent is **feinted** (–2 accuracy penalty on their defense) against your next melee or touch-range attack, lasting until the end of your next turn.

Some powers and feats allow feinting for ranged attacks.

You may use Feint to grant the bonus to an ally instead of yourself. In that case, the ally benefits whether attacking at range or melee.

Feint can be used only once per round per player and only against one enemy, even with special feints like Accelerated Feint. If you have Partners, only one can feint.

---

#### **FLANKING**  
When you fight melee with an opponent and an ally fights melee on the opposite side — i.e., the enemy is exactly between you — you are **flanking** the target.

- The target suffers –1 accuracy on defense when flanked (weakened defense).
	
- To flank, both attackers must be positioned accordingly before the attack starts.
	
- You may use any melee attack check for flanking: Strike, maneuver feat, or touch technique.
	
- Flanking is not possible at range.

---

#### **MERCY STRIKE**  
You deliver a lethal attack against a helpless (or paralyzed) opponent.

A mercy strike is a single melee or ranged attack with automatic critical hit and requires a full action (attacks that are already full actions cannot be used for mercy strikes).

Besides taking damage, the victim makes a Vigor check (DC 10). If failed, they either die or are knocked out, attacker’s choice. Minions do not get this check.

After the mercy strike, the effect, technique, or maneuver that left the victim helpless ends immediately. You cannot use this maneuver against multiple targets at once.

---

#### **STRIKE**  
A melee attack, armed or unarmed. All Strike checks use the Melee Combat (MC) level as accuracy.

- To attack with a weapon, the character must be proficient (buy Weapon Training feat). Otherwise, –3 penalty applies.
	
- Simple weapons can be used by any character without feats. See Weapon Table for simple and martial weapons.
	
- You may only strike adjacent targets. An adjacent target is within 1 meter for medium-sized characters. Long weapons double this range to 2 meters. Larger creatures can strike farther.
	
- If the character wields a weapon with their off-hand (e.g., if main hand is injured), they take –3 accuracy penalty.

To attack with two weapons simultaneously, the Two-Weapon Fighting feat is required.

---

#### **CHARGE**  
With a full action, you can use the Run maneuver (Athletics, minimum 3m) to advance in a straight line and at the end make a single melee attack or special maneuver (trample, knockdown, or push).

You get +1 on the attack check for momentum but suffer –1 on defense accuracy until your next turn, as your guard is open.

Charge cannot be used with touch techniques unless otherwise stated.

---

#### **THROW PROJECTILE**  
With a standard action, you throw projectiles at a target, such as knives, kunai, shuriken, or senbon.

- All throw projectile checks use Ranged Combat (RC) as accuracy, even if in melee range with the target.
	
- Throwing projectiles at any target while an enemy is in melee range imposes –3 accuracy penalty.
	
- Simple throwing weapons need to be thrown in at least the quantity indicated in the Weapon Table to deal damage.
	- Example: Shuriken have a (3) next to their name and +1 weapon damage, meaning you must throw 3 units to add +1 weapon damage on your ranged attack. Note this damage is for all thrown weapons total, not per unit!
	
- The number shown is the amount possible to throw with one hand. You can throw the same amount with the other hand simultaneously, doubling weapon damage. Only one attack check is needed for all projectiles.
	
- Most thrown projectiles are simple weapons usable without proficiency. For martial or special weapons, proficiency is required or –3 penalty applies.
- 
	You can split thrown projectiles among different targets, dividing damage accordingly. See the Multiattack feat.

---

#### **PROJECTILE DEFLECTION**  
You can throw your thrown weapons to deflect enemy projectiles aimed at you or an ally.

- This requires throwing the same number of projectiles as the attacker, requires the Quick Draw feat, and cannot be done if the opponent has higher Dexterity than you.
	
- As a defense, spend a partial action and make an RC check against the attacker’s attack check. On success, the projectiles collide midair and no one takes damage.
	
- You cannot use explosive tags on kunai for this maneuver but may use it against opponent’s tagged kunai. The tags explode midair when deflected, injuring those nearby.

---

#### **FIGHT DEFENSIVELY**  
You may choose to fight defensively by declaring it before making a melee attack.

- You take –3 accuracy penalty on attacks and gain +2 Dodge bonus until your next turn.
	
- The Defensive Combat feat improves defensive fighting benefits (–2 attack penalty for +3 Dodge bonus).

**Total Defense:** Using your standard action, you forgo attacks to fight fully defensively.

- This grants +3 bonus to Dodge and Anticipate maneuvers until your next turn.
	
- You cannot perform offensive actions during total defense, even if they use movement or partial actions, and may only use personal-range techniques.
	
- You also cannot move except via Safe Step. Sustained techniques remain; concentration techniques end immediately.

---

#### SAFE STEP (1 METER)

You use your movement action to move exactly 1 meter in any direction. The safe step is always exactly 1 meter (never more, never less) and **never provokes opportunity attacks**. This maneuver follows the movement limit, so you cannot perform more than one safe step per round.

You can perform the safe step before, during, or after any other actions in the same round. For example:

- draw a weapon (partial action), perform the 1-meter safe step, then attack (standard action);
    
- or cast the fireball technique (standard action), perform the safe step to move through a door, then close the door (free action).
    

When using safe step to move away from an enemy, you no longer suffer penalties for performing techniques or ranged attacks (unless the enemy’s melee reach is greater than 1 meter).

Any creature with a movement speed of 1 meter or less **cannot** perform the safe step, as it requires a movement action to cover that distance.

---

#### PREPARE ACTION

This action allows you to prepare a standard action to perform later—after your turn but before your next turn. To do this, state the action you will attempt and under what circumstances. Then, at any time before your next turn, you can perform the prepared action as a reaction to those circumstances.

The prepared action occurs immediately after the trigger you chose. This creates various unexpected and situational combat scenarios that depend on the GM to resolve.

Example: you ready a melee attack that will be performed as soon as the enemy tries to attack you. When the enemy attacks, the trigger for the prepared action allows you to also attack, simultaneously, as a reaction! In this case, attacks may cancel each other out or both combatants may be harmed, depending on the GM.

When the trigger occurs, you still must make any necessary check for the chosen action (e.g., attack roll).

If you have not performed your prepared action by your next turn, you lose the right to perform it (although you may ready the same action again).

Preparing an action is always a standard action, and you cannot use other actions together with it. However, you may convert your standard action into a movement or partial action within the preparing.

---

#### DRAW WEAPON OR OBJECT

During combat, drawing and readying a weapon or sheathing it to free a hand requires a partial action. This also applies to easily reachable objects that function as weapons, like explosives.

Drawing thrown weapons (such as shuriken or kunai) is also a partial action. However, you may draw multiple at once, as many as fit in one or both hands (normally 3 weapons per hand). Drawing two weapons using Ambidexterity is a single action.

Drawing ammunition for ranged weapons (such as arrows or bolts) is also a partial action but can be done as a free action if you draw the firing weapon in the same turn.

Picking up any other object that is not a weapon and does not have a special rule is a movement action. Handing a weapon or other object to someone else (whether placing in their hands or tossing it to them) is a movement action plus the action needed for them to draw it.

---

### PREDICTION MANEUVERS

To use the Prediction Maneuvers listed here, you must succeed in a contested Anticipate Movement (AM) check against an incoming physical or power attack, ranged or melee.

Except for **Anticipate**, no other Prediction Maneuver may be used against opportunity attacks or when caught off-guard. However, the maneuvers **Nullify**, **Overcome**, and **Defend with Technique** can be used to defend an ally.

Most prediction maneuvers require movement, standard, or both types of actions to use. This means you must have the required action available at the moment you perform the defense. Meeting this requirement, you spend the required action and perform the defense regardless of your initiative order. The action and chakra cost (if any) must be spent before the AM check. If the AM check fails, the defense is not performed in time, but the costs and actions are not recovered.


#### ANTICIPATE

The character tries to predict the attack’s trajectory and get out of the way. Anticipate is a reaction (free action).

---

#### EVADE

By spending a movement action, you can move while defending yourself, moving in any direction you choose. During this movement, you can also dive behind any cover you find along the way. This movement does **not provoke opportunity attacks** from the enemy you are defending against, but **does provoke opportunity attacks from any other enemies within melee range at the start or during your movement**.

You cannot use this maneuver if you have already moved by any other method during this round. If you fail the Anticipate Movement (AM) check, in addition to taking the attack, your movement is interrupted (and in this case, it does not count against your movement limit).

---

#### NULLIFY TECHNIQUE

The character must use a standard action to counter the enemy’s power with an identical or appropriate attack (water jet against fire jet, or fire jet against fire jet, etc.). Only techniques that cause damage and use the Ninpou rules can be nullified.

The difference between the power levels of the two techniques cannot be greater than 1. Metaskills cannot be used in this maneuver, nor can it be used against powers enhanced by metaskills.

The character may also use this maneuver by using touch techniques to block other techniques, including area attacks (e.g., using Raiton – Lightning Blade to parry a Raiton – Missile).

---

#### OVERCOME TECHNIQUE

You must use this prediction maneuver immediately after successfully nullifying a technique, spending a movement action.

This maneuver can only be used to confront techniques of the same range type: ranged technique against ranged technique, or touch technique against touch technique.

If the base damage of your technique used to nullify is greater than the enemy’s technique (also applying elemental advantages), make an attack check with -3 penalty against the opponent, who defends normally.

If successful, your technique overcomes the enemy’s technique, dealing base damage equal to the difference between the techniques’ damage values.

---

#### DEFEND WITH TECHNIQUE

A character who wins an Anticipate Movement check against an enemy’s power can block or defend against the power using any available defensive technique, as described in the power or corresponding Effect.

---

#### HELP ALLY

By making an Anticipate Movement check and spending a standard action, you can help an ally in a way not described by the other maneuvers (for example, holding them if they are being knocked down, or jumping in front of an ally to take a hit for them).

Besides the standard action, you must also spend any other actions necessary to carry out your intention (for example, using a movement action to run to the ally you will help).

---

### SPECIAL MANEUVERS

A special maneuver is a melee attack to do something other than cause damage—such as disarming the opponent or pushing them off a cliff. Use a standard action and make an MC (Melee Combat) check at -2 against the target, who is entitled to defend. If the target is larger than you, they receive +1 to their defense precision plus an additional +1 for each size category above yours.

All special maneuvers are unarmed combat maneuvers. If you are wielding a sword, for example, you can attempt the _Trample_ maneuver with a kick, using your MC precision for unarmed attack (not the precision of the sword). Some weapons (like Nunchaku) and feats (like Warrior) allow performing special maneuvers using the armed attack precision.

---

#### GRAB

To use this maneuver, you must have both hands free or be wielding a weapon that allows the maneuver. Creatures without hands or another way to hold an enemy cannot perform this maneuver.

A grabbed creature is _restrained_ and cannot move (it suffers weakened attack and defense, cannot use Dodge or Anticipate against area attacks, and has a fixed defense equal to 9).

**Breaking free:** The victim can free themselves with a standard action by succeeding on a resisted MC check or a resisted Strength check. They can also free themselves using the Escape skill (Difficulty equal to 4 + attacker’s CC or 7 + attacker’s Strength, attacker’s choice).

**Maintaining the hold:** To maintain a grabbed creature, you must spend your standard action and keep both hands occupied. You are considered slow and drag the grabbed creature when you move. You may release it with a free action.

If you suffer damage while maintaining the hold, the victim gets a reaction check to break free.

**Freeing an ally:** To free someone grabbed by an enemy, you make the same check as the grab maneuver to separate the enemy from the grabbed ally.

**Sharing space:** Although you do not occupy the same space, you and the grabbed creature are always as close as possible. You are also considered restrained when attacked while maintaining the hold.

Area attacks may hit both you and the grabbed creature. When single-target melee, projectile, or technique attacks against the grabbed creature miss, there is a 50% chance they hit you: roll 1 die; if the result is 4 or less, you are hit. The attacker uses the same attack check made against the grabbed creature, and you are entitled to a defensive action.

---

#### TRAMPLE

This maneuver must be used with _Charge_ and is used to knock down the target and/or advance so they cannot stay in your path. Make an MC check; if you succeed, you advance and knock down the target, who falls prone.

If the target succeeds with a Dodge or Anticipate, they simply step aside and avoid the maneuver. If they succeed with a Block, they remain standing and stop your advance. For other defense types, apply their specific effects.

---

#### TAKEDOWN

You knock down a standing target, leaving them prone. This fall usually does not cause damage but may require an Acrobatics check to avoid damage from a fall of great height.

---

#### DISARM

You knock away an item or weapon the creature is holding. The item falls 3 meters away, plus 1 meter for every 4 points of difference between your attack roll and their defense.

Picking up the item from the ground is a partial action.

---

#### PUSH

You push the creature 1 meter. For every 4 points of difference between the attack and defense rolls, you push the target an additional 1 meter.

You must advance alongside the target to push it, up to your movement limit.

---

### COMMANDING A PARTNER

A Partner is an extra character controlled by the Player. Examples of partners include a clone, a summon, or an animal companion.

Each type of Partner may have special usage rules, but all follow the general rules below.

**Sheet and Accuracy:** These are described in the rules for each Partner.

**Giving Commands:** Issuing commands is a free action for the Character, regardless of the order. The Partner is fully obedient to the Character unless their specific rules say otherwise. The Partner will execute all orders given, as long as they have actions available and it is within their capabilities.

**Actions and Initiative:** The Partner does not have initiative. They act in the same turn as the Character and can act as soon as summoned (if applicable) with access to all action types (standard, move, partial, and free). However, when a Partner uses their standard action, it causes penalties to the Character.

**Attack Damage:** The damage from attacks by both the Partner and the Character is divided by the number of standard actions used by both in the same round. For example, if both the Character and the Partner attack in the same round, that counts as 2 standard actions used, and therefore the damage of each attack is divided by 2.

If there were 2 Partners attacking alongside the Character, that would be 3 standard actions used, and the damage would be divided by three.

Note that what matters is whether the standard action is used or not, not how it is used. If the Character uses a technique that does not cause damage and the Partner punches, that punch’s damage will be divided by two, because two standard actions were used.

This rule affects both base damage and fixed damage, but does **not** affect values of chakra drain/loss caused by techniques and attacks (such as Juuken and Kikaichuu).

If you want the Character or their Partner to skip using their standard action that round, you must announce it before acting.

**Limited Techniques and Maneuvers:** The Partner shares your limits on maneuvers and techniques usage, such as Opportunity Attack and Kawarimi no Jutsu. So, if you perform an opportunity attack that round, your Partner cannot perform one (since by the rules only one opportunity attack is allowed per round). Similarly, if your Partner uses Kawarimi no Jutsu in that scene, you cannot use it afterward. This rule does not affect feats and powers.

---

### MOUNTS

Mounted combat is quite common in the ninja world, although with big differences: while ordinary horses are used merely as transport for civilians, ninjas usually employ large summons and beings created with techniques to assist in battles.

**Using a mount:** Getting on any type of mount is a movement action. Moving with a mount is also a movement action that must be spent both by the character and the mount (if the mount does not have actions, only the character spends the movement action).

**Common Mount:** Using a common mount (such as horses) requires Animal Handling 2 and no check is necessary.

Common mounts have no actions. They also cannot be used in combat (they get scared as soon as a fight starts). If the mount gets scared (by combat or any other reason), you must make an Animal Handling or Acrobatics check, DC 12. If you fail, you lose control of the mount and are unbalanced, falling to the ground (this fall does not cause damage).

**Special Mount:** Summoned snakes or wooden golems are examples of special mounts. In combat, the ninja usually stands on the mount, securing themselves with the basic Kinobori jutsu.

Only creatures of Large size or bigger can be used as special mounts. When you are attacked (whether the attack also hits the mount or not), defensive reactions must be made by the mount (Dodge, Block, and Anticipate). You may still use defensive techniques, but only one defense is allowed per attack (that is, if you choose to defend using the mount’s Dodge and fail, you cannot use a defensive technique against that attack).

Size modifiers to accuracy apply normally. So, if you defend using the mount’s Dodge, a Medium attacker will get a bonus to their attack accuracy due to the size difference, even if the initial target of the attack was not the creature.

**Taking Damage:** If you suffer an attack with Damage Grade 3, immediately make an Acrobatics check (DC 4 + attacker’s attack accuracy). If you fail, you fall to the ground.

If the attack hits both you and your mount, both must make the check, and you fall if either fails.

If the attack was a critical hit, Acrobatics checks are automatic failures.

This fall causes no damage unless the mount has wings. If so, apply the flight disturbance rules for Aerial Combat.

---

### AERIAL COMBAT

When one of the characters can fly—whether by having wings, a levitation technique, or a mount with the Flight skill—an aerial combat situation occurs. Some special rules apply in this situation.

**Flying:** Starting to fly is a movement action that must be spent in addition to any other actions needed to prepare the flight, such as mounting a flying creature or executing a levitation technique. When you start flying, you move only vertically, ascending in height. Taking off or moving in the air are still considered movements and can provoke opportunity attacks.

**Flight Height:** Outside of combat, your maximum flight height is determined by the rules that allow you to fly (for example, the Flight skill of a winged mount). But in combat, flight height varies at each moment of the fight. Instead of tracking height every round, you receive the special winged condition, following these rules.

**Ceiling in enclosed spaces:** Flying in open areas requires no special attention. However, flying in enclosed spaces requires a minimum difference of 10 meters between floor and ceiling. If this space is not available, even if you are flying in the scene, aerial combat rules do not apply.

**Movement:** Outside combat, winged creatures move according to the Flight skill rules. Inside combat, however, height is disregarded and you must consider the winged creature moves only horizontally.

**Ranged Combat:** Attacking or targeting a winged creature from the ground halves the attack’s range. If a winged creature attacks a target on the ground, it ignores any vertical cover present before the attack and cancels defense bonuses of prone targets.

**Melee Combat:** To make a melee attack against a winged creature, you must also be winged or have some way to reach your enemy, such as running up the wall of a nearby building using the basic Kinobori jutsu, or through a technique that extends your melee reach, like the Chakra Arm from the hijutsu Jinchuuriki.

**Jump Attack:** You can perform the Charge maneuver to run, jump, and attack a winged target. If you do this, your total movement is halved and you do not receive the Charge precision bonus (but still suffer the penalty). At the end of the maneuver, you land 1 meter past the target’s position. A critical failure on your Athletics check means you miss the jump, take fall damage, and fall prone.

**Winged Attack:** If your flying ability does not allow you to hover in place, you can only make melee attacks if you have and use the Moving Attack skill (against winged targets or not). If flying by mount, both you and the mount must have this skill.

**Flight Disturbance:** Any attack that deals damage may disrupt your flight and knock you to the ground. If you suffer an attack with Damage Grade 3, immediately make an Acrobatics check (DC 4 + attacker’s attack accuracy). If you fail, you fall to the ground.

If the attack hits both you and your mount, both must make the check, and you fall if either fails (if the mount fails, it also falls).

If the attack was a critical hit, Acrobatics checks automatically fail.

**Movement Restrictions:** If you (or your winged mount, if applicable) suffer the conditions impeded, paralyzed, or unconscious, you immediately fall to the ground. You also fall if subjected to the Knockdown maneuver.

**Fall:** Whatever the cause, falling in aerial combat causes fixed damage equal to the character’s Vigor, and the character falls prone. This damage cannot be reduced by skill checks.

---

### CREATURE SIZE

**Strength and Vigor:** Larger characters naturally have more powerful muscles, while smaller ones have less. Strength and Vigor modifiers are applied after normal character creation and can exceed the campaign's attribute limits. Strength bonuses do **not** affect the calculation of Unarmed Combat (see p. 251). These Strength and Vigor bonuses serve to meet prerequisites and for calculating Vitality, provided the size increase is **permanent** (such as summons from Kuchiyose powers), not temporary (like Baika no Jutsu or Bijuu Form).

**Attack:** Attack modifiers apply to Combat Skill accuracies. Larger characters are more noticeable and easier to hit compared to smaller ones. Apply the following modifiers:  
Whenever attacking a larger target, add +1 to CC (Close Combat) and CD (Distance Combat) for every 2 size categories difference.

| Size       | Strength & Vigor | Attack (vs Medium) | Melee Reach | Stealth Penalty | Intimidate Bonus | Movement Modifier | Height Range     | Weight Range     |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Minuscule  | -7               | +2 CC and CD       | 1 m         | +5              | -2               | -12 m             | 15 cm or less    | 125 g or less    |
| Petite     | -5               | +1 CC and CD       | 1 m         | +3              | -2               | -9 m              | 15 cm to 30 cm   | 125 g to 0.5 kg  |
| Slight     | -3               | +1 CC and CD       | 1 m         | +2              | -1               | -6 m              | 30 cm to 60 cm   | 0.5 kg to 4 kg   |
| Modest     | -1               | +0                 | 1 m         | +1              | -1               | -3 m              | 60 cm to 1.2 m   | 4 kg to 30 kg    |
| Standard   | +0               | +0                 | 1 m         | +0              | +0               | +0 m              | 1.2 m to 2.4 m   | 30 kg to 250 kg  |
| Grand      | +1               | +0                 | 2 m         | -1              | +1               | +3 m              | 2.4 m to 4.8 m   | 250 kg to 2 t    |
| Massive    | +3               | +0                 | 3 m         | -2              | +1               | +6 m              | 4.8 m to 9.6 m   | 2 t to 16 t      |
| Vast       | +5               | +0                 | 4 m         | -3              | +2               | +9 m              | 9.6 m to 19.2 m  | 16 t to 125 t    |
| Titanic    | +7               | +0                 | 5 m         | -5              | +2               | +12 m             | 19.2 m to 38.4 m | 125 t to 1,000 t |
| Monumental | +9               | +0                 | 6 m         | -7              | +3               | +15 m             | 38.4 m or more   | 1,000 t or more  |

_These attack adjustments apply only when the target defends using reactions such as Dodge, Block, or Anticipate._  
_It is not possible to block attacks from enemies 2 or more size categories larger than you._  
_The table shows modifiers for attacks against a Medium-sized target._

**Melee Range:** A normal Medium-sized character has a 1-meter reach, meaning they can make melee attacks against targets up to 1 meter away. Larger characters have longer reach, as shown in the Size table.

From the Immense category onwards, if all enemies in front within your melee reach are 3 or more size categories smaller than you, you can attack all of them simultaneously, making a single CC check against each target’s individual defense. You cannot use maneuver skills when attacking this way.

**Stealth:** Larger characters have more difficulty sneaking, while smaller characters can slip by more easily. Apply this modifier to the character’s Stealth accuracy.

**Intimidate:** Larger characters are more imposing. Apply this modifier to Intimidate checks and to difficulties resisting fear effects. This modifier cancels out against opponents of the same size.

**Movement:** Larger creatures take longer strides; smaller creatures take shorter steps. Movement modifiers cannot reduce movement below 1 meter.

**Height and Weight:** Reference values for the height and weight of creatures by size category.

---

### **CAMOUFLAGE AND COVERAGE**

**Camouflage:** You receive camouflage when some effect interferes with enemies’ vision. It can be darkness, fog, foliage... — either where you are or in the space between you and the enemy.

- **Partial:** Attacks against you have a 25% chance to fail, regardless of whether the attack roll hits or not (the attacker rolls 1 die, and if it’s 2 or less, the attack fails). The camouflage failure check must be made after the attack success roll. Critical hits always succeed and bypass the camouflage check.
    
- **Total:** You receive total camouflage when your enemies cannot see you — for example, in a completely dark chamber or if you are invisible in some way. The failure chance for total camouflage is 50% (the attacker rolls 1 die, and if it’s 4 or less, the attack fails).
    

With total camouflage, your enemies must be able to find you by other means than sight, even if only approximately. If they cannot, they cannot attack you and any attempt automatically fails. They also cannot use techniques or powers that don’t require an attack roll but need to know the target’s position (such as mind control techniques).

To determine approximate enemy location, a Stealth check versus Notice or Search is necessary, or information must be received from an ally with Sensor.

Conversely, if you cannot see the enemy and are attacked by them, you are considered unprepared.

Characters with Sensor abilities (like the Sensor feat or Kagura Shingan) always have exact locations of creatures and are unaffected by camouflage failure. If someone with Sensor informs an ally about the enemy’s position, the ally can attack, but still suffers camouflage failure.

Area attacks may not be affected by camouflage in an environment. If the attack area is larger than the failure chance, the attacker does not need to roll for failure.

This means the attack area must cover at least 25% of the partial camouflage area or 50% of the total camouflage area.

However, the attacker must still know the approximate position of the target.

Unless stated otherwise, camouflage effects in the same environment do not stack (e.g., fog and smoke bombs). However, environmental camouflage stacks with individual character penalties, and darkness camouflage always stacks with any other. For example, a character with vision problems suffers cumulative camouflage with darkness and must roll two separate camouflage dice.


**Coverage:** You receive coverage when behind something that blocks enemy attacks, like a tree, pillar, side of a cart, or a larger creature. You only receive coverage if it exists before the enemy’s attack (i.e., a barrier created during defense or running behind a wall during Evade does not provide coverage bonuses).

- **Partial:** Partial coverage grants +3 to defense precision.
    
- **Total:** You receive total coverage when enemies cannot reach you — for example, behind a wall. Total coverage prevents you from being hit by projectiles and melee attacks. For other attack types, it functions as partial coverage.
    

If the attacker deals enough damage to overcome the coverage (breaking the wall, for example), you may suffer the remaining damage.

---

### **HARDNESS AND BREAKING OBJECTS**

Sometimes it is necessary to break an object, especially if it is blocking a path or holding an ally (like effects such as Handcuffs or Ninpou Barrier).

Trying to break or destroy an inanimate object — from a locked door to a sword wielded by an opponent — is different from attacking a creature.

**Attacking an Object:**  
Hitting a stationary object requires a check against a defense of difficulty 5. A moving object has defense difficulty 9. For an object being carried by another creature, use the Disarm maneuver.

If the object is larger or smaller than the character, you may apply the attack modifiers for Melee Combat (MC) and Ranged Combat (RC) from the Size Table.

If you hit the attack, you cause normal damage to the object, reducing its hardness or damaging its absorption.

**Hardness:**  
Hardness indicates how much damage an object can receive without breaking, and it is checked before applying the damage degree. If an object with hardness 5 suffers an attack with base damage 5, it breaks; but it does not break if the attack causes 4 base damage or less.

Each time an object is damaged but not enough to break, its hardness is reduced by 2 points.

The GM can freely determine the hardness of an object but may use the example table at the end to get a better sense when choosing hardness values. For weapons, if necessary, hardness can be calculated as 10 + 5 times their damage value (you don't need to worry about weapon hardness and may simply ignore it unless someone specifically wants to break them).

**Hardness against Fixed Damage:**  
Multiply hardness by 2 when comparing against Fixed Damage. If the attack has both normal and fixed damage, perform the comparisons separately to determine the final damage.

**Hardness of Barriers:**  
When you protect yourself with a barrier or run behind some cover, like a wall or tree, the damage you would receive is reduced by the hardness before applying the damage degree.

For example, if the Barrier has hardness 7 and a character wants to use it to defend against a technique causing 9 damage, the barrier breaks and 2 damage surpass the protection and are suffered by the character with the degree defined in the enemy's attack check.

**Imaginary Hardness:**  
This is the hardness of gaseous substances like air, smoke, and fog. This hardness exists only as a comparison criterion to know if the gas is dissipated or not by an attack. If imaginary hardness is not specified, its value is 1.

Whenever an area attack with explosions (e.g., Katon) or winds (e.g., Fuuton) is used over or inside the gas area, its hardness is reduced. If hardness reaches zero, it dissipates. Imaginary hardness follows all common rules for object hardness but does **not** protect against damage (base damage from attacks is **not** reduced by imaginary hardness!).

**Body Hardness:**  
Some powers or feats provide hardness to the character’s own body, such as the Stone Skin effect (Doton) and the Resilience feat (Akimichi). In these cases, hardness protects the character against all attacks and is not reduced or lost, even if damage is higher.

Body hardness does not stack. If you have more than one such bonus, apply only the highest (unless the specific rule says otherwise).

As with any hardness, each 1 point of body hardness reduces the base damage of the attack you suffer by 1. For example, if an attack has base damage 5 and you have body hardness 1, you only suffer 4 base damage (which is then multiplied by the damage degree).

**Multi-attacks:**  
If the object or creature is the target of a Multiattack or an effect with damage division (like the Ninpou Arrows effect), reduce the attack damage by hardness **before** dividing the base damage.

To know if the object breaks or not, compare the total base damage suffered by the object against its hardness.

**Ignoring Hardness:**  
Some techniques allow ignoring part or all of the hardness of an object or creature. In this case, just reduce the object's hardness by the ignored amount to get the final hardness value.

Effects that ignore hardness are not cumulative: apply only the highest.

**Absorption:**  
This parameter is exclusive to armor, constructions, and some mechanisms, functioning like their HP.

In this case, apply the damage degree and subtract the total damage from the absorption value of the armor, construction, or object.

If absorption is reduced to zero, the object is destroyed or rendered unusable (depending on its function).

**Example Hardness Table:**

|Object|Size|Hardness|
|---|---|---|
|Pot|Minuscule|0|
|Scroll|Diminutive|0|
|Rope|Tiny|0|
|Book|Tiny|0|
|Chain|Tiny|10|
|Chair|Small|5|
|Wooden Door|Large|5|
|Stone Door|Large|8|
|Iron Door|Large|10|

### FALL DAMAGE

If a character falls from a great height, they may suffer damage from the fall. You take 1 fixed damage for every 1 meter of fall height. The fixed damage from falling cannot exceed twice the victim's Vigor.

For deadly falls (such as falling off a cliff), the victim may instantly enter the **dying** condition, depending on the scene and the GM’s criteria.

You can perform an Acrobatics check to soften the fall as a free action. For every 2 points above 9 that you achieve on your check, reduce the fall height by 1 meter.

If the fall is due to a jump, you may use Athletics instead of Acrobatics to soften the damage.

### NEGATIVE CONDITIONS

These are harmful conditions that can affect characters. A character may suffer these conditions due to an effect, technique, feats, or power. The rules to remove a condition are described in the effect that caused it.

The GM can also apply a harmful condition to a player for narrative reasons (e.g., a character who catches a cold may receive the Fatigued or Exhausted condition). In such cases, the GM decides how the player gets rid of the condition.

- If several conditions affect the same character, apply all of them.
    
- If one condition is more severe than another, apply only the more severe one.
    
- If different conditions apply penalties to accuracy, sum these penalties up to a maximum of -3 on the same check.
    
- Penalties from a condition **never** apply to the checks made to get rid of that condition. For example, if a condition requires a Vigor check to remove it, that Vigor check does not receive penalties from that condition (but may receive penalties from other different conditions).
    
- For removing conditions, the victim must make a check for **each** condition they are suffering, even if conditions are repeated.
    
- If the current condition evolved from another (e.g., Fatigued to Exhausted), first pass the check to return to the less severe condition, then make the check to become totally free.
