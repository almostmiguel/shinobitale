The **Perception Attribute** represents how sharp a characterâ€™s senses are and their ability to interpret instincts in time to avoid surprises in certain situations.

Shinobi skilled in Genjutsu, as well as those who frequently undertake missions in unfamiliar locations, typically have this [[2. Mechanics/Character Rules/4. - Attributes\|Attribute]] well-developed.

This system does not use fixed ranges for vision (except for special vision, like the Byakugan). If you need to determine whether a character can see something at a distance, use Perception checks or related [[2. Mechanics/Character Rules/6. - Skills\|Skills]], such as [[2. Mechanics/Skills/General/Search\|Search]].
