The Strength Attribute represents a character’s muscular capacity, from carrying heavy objects to delivering devastating blows. Shinobi skilled in close-quarters combat, such as Taijutsu, typically have this Attribute well-developed.

A character can carry a weight equal to 10 kg per level of Strength. Large-sized or larger characters can carry at least their own weight, while small-sized or smaller characters can carry up to their own weight. Use these values as guidelines, but don’t treat them as rigid rules.

Strength checks are used when a character needs to carry or move something heavier than their capacity allows, restrain something or someone in a grapple, or break objects of great durability.
