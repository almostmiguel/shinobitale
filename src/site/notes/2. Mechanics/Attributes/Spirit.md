The Spirit Attribute represents a character’s control over their chakra, both in manipulating it and extracting it from their body. Shinobi who frequently use Ninjutsu typically have this Attribute well-developed, as many Ninjutsu techniques require significant chakra control.

Spirit also determines the character’s chakra pool.
