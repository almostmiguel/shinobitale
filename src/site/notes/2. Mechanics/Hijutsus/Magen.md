**Prerequisites**: Intelligence 6, Fascinate, Mirage, Deep Illusion (Feats)

You possess an extraordinary talent for genjutsu, excelling from the earliest stages of your ninja career. The barriers that limit ordinary shinobi in using genjutsu are completely shattered by you, creating illusions so vivid they blur the line between illusion and reality.

The character can create illusions at will, either affecting themselves (altering how others perceive them) or mental illusions (sending chakra to the target’s body to manipulate their chakra network, causing them to imagine things that aren’t real). As long as the rules of this power are followed, the user can create any image, sound, or sensation they desire. **Magen** illusions are divided into three types:

- **Phantom**: External illusions affecting only the user’s body, altering how others perceive them.
- **Compulsion**: Mental illusions existing only in the target’s mind, forcing them to act differently.
- **Affliction**: Instantaneous mental illusions causing significant psychological shock, briefly altering the target’s mental state.

## EFFECTS

For **Phantom**, **Compulsion**, and **Affliction** illusions, the user selects **Effects** following the same rules as the **Ninpou** power, but only Effects listed in **Magen** can be used. If an Effect offers multiple options, the user chooses one.

- **Action**: Standard (unless specified otherwise by the Effect).
- **Chakra Cost**: Equals the Effect’s level.
- **Check**: No accuracy check is required to use this power.
    - For **external illusions** (Phantom), observers must interact with the illusion to determine its reality.
    - For **mental illusions** (Compulsion, Affliction), the target must pass an **Intelligence check** or succumb. DC = **9 + Magen Power Level + ½ Intelligence (rounded up)**, including the **Deep Illusion** bonus. Against **minions**, increase DC by **+3**.
- **Duration**: Varies by illusion type:
    - **Phantom**: Duration specified in the Effect’s description.
    - **Compulsion**: Continuous until the target breaks free.
    - **Affliction**: Continuous for **2 turns**.
- **Range**: Short (**5m + 1m per Intelligence level**). Targets must be within this range for mental illusions.
    - Mental illusions can be transmitted by touch with a **Melee Combat (MC)** check against the target’s defense. If successful, the resistance check DC becomes **8 + 2x Magen Power Level** (including Deep Illusion bonus). Once the illusion takes hold, range limitations no longer apply.
- **Size**: Mental illusions can have dimensions up to **1m per Intelligence level** (diameter, length, width, or height).
- **Targets**: Affects one target, whose exact position must be known.
    - Multiple targets can be affected with the same mental illusion for the same chakra cost and action, but resistance DC decreases by **-1 per additional target**.

---
**NOTICING GENJUTSU:**
* Starting from the **second turn** under a genjutsu’s effect, before acting, the target can make an **Intelligence Check** as a **reaction** to notice they’re in an illusion. DC = **standard resistance -1**, with an additional **-1** per subsequent attempt.
* Success allows the target to attempt to break free (see below). Applies to **Phantom** and **Compulsion** illusions.

**EVALUATING GENJUTSU:**
* If a creature acts unusually after the first turn under a genjutsu, others can make a **Perception Check** (movement action, DC = standard resistance -2, with -1 per additional attempt) to confirm they’re affected.
* If the evaluator has the **Magen** power and the same Effect, the Check is an **Automatic Success**.

**CANCELING GENJUTSU:**
- Use the **Kai** technique on the target.
- Deal damage to the target (**minimum damage = double the genjutsu’s chakra cost**).
- If the target notices the genjutsu, they can use **Kai** on themselves or self-inflict damage (standard action, choosing damage degree). Self-damage isn’t possible if **stunned** or **paralyzed**. Damage-based cancellation applies only to **Compulsion** illusions.

**ILLUSIONS AND CHAKRA VISION:**
- **Phantom Illusions**: Characters with **chakra vision** automatically identify these as illusions and are never deceived.
- **Mental Illusions** (Compulsion, Affliction): Chakra vision offers no advantage, as they occur in the target’s mind, but observers can detect if a third party is affected.

**REPEATING GENJUTSU:**
- A successfully used effect cannot deceive the same target again in the same scene unless the effect allows it.

**OVERLAPPING GENJUTSU:**
- Multiple **Affliction** or **Compulsion** illusions cannot affect the same target simultaneously. A new genjutsu cancels the previous one, overwriting it.

## LEVEL 1 EFFECTS

#### ECSTASY (COMPULSION)

- The user traps the target’s mind in a chosen illusion, leaving them **fascinated**.

#### CONFUSE (COMPULSION)

- Creates hallucinations or random illusions that change each round, leaving the target **confused**.

#### FATIGUE (AFFLICTION)

- **Evolutions**:
    - **Fatigue Level 5**: The target becomes **exhausted**.

#### HOLD (COMPULSION)

    - **Hold Level 10**: The illusion’s creature is much larger or stronger, rendering the target **helpless**.

## LEVEL 3 EFFECTS

#### SLEEP (COMPULSION)

    - **Sleep Level 9**: Fatigue duration reduces to **3 turns**.

#### DISABLE SENSE (COMPULSION)

    - **Hearing**: The target takes a **-2 penalty** to auditory **Search** and **Notice** checks.
    - **Smell**: The target loses the ability to detect odors.
    - **Sight**: The target suffers **partial camouflage** penalties.
    - If the affected sense is tied to a sensory ability (e.g., chakra sensing), that ability is also impaired.

- **Evolutions**:
    - **Unbalance Level 6**: The target cannot stand for **two turns**.

## LEVEL 4 EFFECTS

    - **Relief Level 7**: Effect lasts **3 turns**.
    - **Relief Level 10**: Effect cannot be resisted.

#### FALSE POSITION (PHANTOM)

- An illusion makes enemies ignore your presence, believing you’re elsewhere. When attacked, the enemy makes a **Genjutsu Notice Check**. Failure grants you **partial camouflage** for the scene. Each successful hit allows a new Notice Check; success ends the effect for that enemy. Duration is **sustained**.
- **Evolutions**:
    - **False Position Level 7**: Grants **total camouflage**.
    - **False Position Level 10**: If the enemy misses, you can force them to attack in a direction of your choice.

#### PETRIFY (COMPULSION)

    - **Stun Level 8**: The target is also **flat-footed** for the duration.

##### PARALYZE (COMPULSION)

#### RESTRICTED FEATS

##### FLUID ILLUSION (META)

- **Prerequisite**: Intelligence 12, Magen 6
- **Benefit**: For resistance check DC calculations, use the **target’s Intelligence level** instead of your own, provided your Intelligence is **at least double your Magen level**.
    - **Example**: With Intelligence 12 and Magen 6, standard DC is **21 (Int 12/2 + Magen 6 + 9)**. Against a target with Intelligence 16, Fluid Illusion changes it to **23 (Int 16/2 + Magen 6 + 9)**.
