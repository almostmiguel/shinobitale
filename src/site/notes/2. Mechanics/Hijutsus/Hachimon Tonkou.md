- **Duration**: Continuous (see text)
- **Type**: Taijutsu
- **Subtype**: Kinjutsu
- **Hand Seals**: No

The **Eight Gates** are eight specific points in a shinobi’s chakra circulatory system that act as valves, limiting chakra flow. Rare ninjas can control these valves, unleashing abnormal chakra levels to enhance physical abilities, but this causes severe bodily harm by pushing the body beyond its limits.

**Appearance Changes**: Activating the Gates alters the user’s appearance, often darkening the skin, causing veins to bulge around the temples, and turning the eyes completely white (lacking iris and pupil). The user’s voice may deepen during activation. These changes vary by individual.

## GENERAL RULES

- **Action**:
    - Releasing up to half the available Gates (rounded up) is a **partial action**.
    - Releasing all Gates at once is a **movement action**.
    - Gates can be opened gradually (increasing levels) but not closed gradually (closing shuts all Gates).
- **Duration**:
    - **Level 1**: Lasts **2 turns**.
    - **Level 2+**: Lasts **5 turns**. Gradual opening doesn’t extend duration.
    - After closing, wait **1 turn** before reopening.
- **Chakra Cost**: **Zero**. No chakra is consumed, but the user loses **Hit Points** each turn (see below).
- **Hit Points**:
    - Damage is taken immediately upon opening a Gate and at the start of each subsequent turn, as specified per Gate. From **Gate 3**, damage equals the power level used.
    - If HP reaches **0 or less**, Gates close automatically.
    - Damage from Hachimon Tonkou **cannot break genjutsu** but reduces the difficulty of **genjutsu resistance checks** (see below).
- **Fatigue**:
    - After use, the user is **fatigued** for **4 turns**, regardless of Gate level. For each power level above the Gate used, reduce fatigue by **1 turn** (minimum 1 turn).
    - Example: Hachimon Tonkou 5 using Gate 2 reduces fatigue to **1 turn** (4 - 3).
    - Fatigue duration is based on the highest Gate opened if opened gradually.
    - Gate fatigue **doesn’t stack** with itself but stacks with other fatigue sources.
    - Using Gates **three times consecutively** in one scene causes **exhaustion** for **1 day**. Further use in this state renders the user **unconscious** post-use, with HP damage becoming **permanent** (only curable by **Iyrou Ninjutsu** of equivalent Gate level).
- **Restricted Power**: If the character has another **Hijutsu** or **Clan**, they can only purchase **Level 1** of Hachimon Tonkou.

### BENEFIT RULES

- **Non-Cumulative**: Benefits apply only to the highest Gate opened, except for **healing** (Gate 2+).
- **Bonus Restriction**: All other **Strength** or **damage bonuses** are nullified during Hachimon Tonkou, except **size-based Strength bonuses**, **weapon damage bonuses**, or bonuses explicitly allowed.
- **Strength Bonus**: Gain **Strength equal to the power level**, doubled for damage calculations.
- **Dexterity Bonus**: As specified per Gate, applies to **Dexterity Checks** (e.g., Feint) and **movement speed**.
- **Acceleration**: Grants **Accelerated** or **Super Accelerated** conditions (see below).
- **Healing**: From **Gate 2**, recover HP per turn, reducing effective damage (already factored into Gate descriptions). Gate 2’s fatigue removal persists in higher Gates.
- **Genjutsu Resistance**: Intense chakra flow reduces **genjutsu resistance check difficulty** as specified per Gate.
- **Heavy Attack**: Available from **Gate 2**. Sacrifice remaining Gate duration for massive damage:
    - All attacks in the turn have a **minimum damage degree equal to remaining turns** (e.g., using in turn 1 with 5-turn duration ensures damage degree 4).
    - Requires successful attacks; critical hits (15–16) still needed for **Automatic Success**.
    - Gates close immediately, and the user takes **all remaining turn damage at once**.
    - Post-use fatigue becomes **exhausted**.
    - Targets hit must pass an **Acrobatics Check (DC 9 + 2x Power Level)** or fall **prone**.
    - **Block** defenses are invalid, granting **Automatic Success** to the attack.
