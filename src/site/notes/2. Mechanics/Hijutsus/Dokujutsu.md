# RESTRICTED POWER

**Prerequisite**: Poisoncraft 6, Chemist (Feat)

**Dokujutsu** is the art of wielding poisons in combat, using methods like poisoned needles or toxic fumes as a primary fighting style. This power allows the creation and application of potent toxins with strategic versatility.

**Rules**:

- **Dokujutsu** is purchased as a variant of **Ninpou**, following its rules.
- The player must define the visual interpretation of their **Dokujutsu** (e.g., summoning weapons via scrolls). This is purely aesthetic and does not require **Fuuinjutsu** or its rules, only **Ninpou** mechanics.
- **Improved Poison**:
    - Gain **+2 effective Poisoncraft levels** for all checks and prerequisites related to crafting poisons and antidotes.
    - Poisons gain **+1 resistance check difficulty**.
    - Poisons take effect **1 turn faster**.
    - Access to **Level V poisons**.
- **Key Attribute**: Intelligence (replaces Spirit for range, damage, and resistance check difficulties).
- **Range**: Medium (**10m + 2m per Intelligence level**).
- **Size**: Creations, manipulations, or areas of effect up to **1m diameter, length, width, or height per Intelligence level**.
- **Poison Damage**: Apply a chosen poison with any effect, delivering it via injury, inhalation, or ingestion if the target is hit or affected. Effect damage applies normally alongside poison effects. The delivery method can be altered (e.g., an ingested poison can be inhaled via **Destructive Breath** creating toxic fumes). Used poisons are consumed.
- **Poison Resistance**: Resistance checks for **Dokujutsu** poisons have **DC 8 + Poisoncraft level** (includes **+1** from Improved Poison).
- **Allowed Effects**: Cannon, Orb, Beam, Arrows, Energize, Destructive Breath, Column, Spear, Cloud, Missile, Explosive Wave, Ricochet, Torrent.
- **Poisonous Energize**: Using **Energize** infuses a weapon with a poison dose via chakra, turning it into a poisoned weapon.
