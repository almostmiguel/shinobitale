The **Aburame Clan** is one of Konoha's most prominent and well-known clans. Their **Kekkei Genkai** allows members to commune with small chakra-consuming insects, the **kikaichuu**, living within their bodies. This bond enables Aburame members to control these insects for a variety of **defensive and offensive jutsus**.

**Restricted Feats**: Kikaichuu (Destroyer Parasite Insect), Shōkaichuu (Tracker Parasite Insect), Kidaichuu (Giant Parasite Insect), Rinkaichuu (Poisonous Parasite Insect)  
**Restricted Power**: Kikai Ninpou  
**Insect Hosting**: At birth, Aburame children’s bodies are offered as nests for insects. As they grow, they learn the clan’s secret techniques to command these insects in combat. Most host **kikaichuu** (chakra-draining insects), but other types are also used. Multiple insect types can coexist in the body, with quantities specified per feat. However, **Kidaichuu** and **Rinkaichuu** are mutually exclusive; only one can be chosen.

## RESTRICTED FEATS 

### KIKAICHUU (DESTROYER PARASITE INSECT)

The character hosts chakra-draining insects within their body, using them as weapons and support. Each level must be purchased separately as a feat evolution.

#### LEVEL 1

- **Prerequisite**: Animal Handling 1
- **Benefit**: The character hosts a number of **kikaichuu** (groups of 100 insects, referred to as 1 kikaichuu) based on their **Animal Handling** skill level.
    - **Quantity**: 1 kikaichuu per **Animal Handling** level, additive to other insect types.
    - **Control**: Kikaichuu are under the character’s direct control, loyal, and cannot be commanded by others. They can relay limited information, as determined by the Game Master.
    - **Usage Limitation**: Kikaichuu used in a jutsu (e.g., **Mushi Bunshin no Jutsu**) cannot be used for other purposes simultaneously.
    - **Actions**:
        - **Release/Recall**: Moving kikaichuu in or out of the body is a **free action**.
        - **Attack**: Attacking with kikaichuu is a **standard action**.
        - **Move**: Moving kikaichuu is a **partial action**, with a movement speed of **15m per action**.
    - **Lost Insects**: Outside combat, kikaichuu can stray up to **100m** from the Aburame. Beyond this, they are lost and unusable. Lost or destroyed kikaichuu regenerate in **2 days** via accelerated reproduction. Abandoned kikaichuu disperse after **3 days** without control.
    - **Hit Points and Resistance**: Kikaichuu are fragile, dying to any **lethal damage** (1 kikaichuu for single-target attacks, all in area for AoE attacks). **Non-lethal damage**, **poisons**, and **genjutsu** do not affect them.
    - **Attack**: Use up to **half your total kikaichuu** for a **Ranged Combat** Check. The attack deals **no damage** but drains **chakra equal to the number of kikaichuu used**. No chakra cost to the user, and drained chakra is consumed by the insects. For damaging attacks, use **Kikai Ninpou**. Kikaichuu attacks (including Kikai Ninpou) cannot be defended with **Block**.
    - **Maneuvers**: Kikaichuu alone cannot perform maneuvers like **Sneak Attack** or **Opportunity Attack**, but the Aburame can use them for such maneuvers. Only attacks or maneuvers specified in this feat or **Kikai Ninpou** are allowed.
    - **Defense**: When kikaichuu are targeted, the user can use the **Anticipate** reaction to move them and avoid attacks.
    - **Chakra Below Zero**: If a target with **0 chakra** is drained further, they die if the drained amount equals or exceeds **half their natural chakra reserve** (e.g., 40 reserve dies if 20+ chakra is drained below 0).
    - **Kikaichuu Mastery**: The **Mastery** feat for Kikaichuu applies to all insect types and **Kikai Ninpou**.

#### LEVEL 2

- **Prerequisite**: Animal Handling 10
- **Benefit**: Grants greater control over kikaichuu with the following abilities:
    - **Notice Genjutsu**: If the genjutsu allows, the Aburame can observe kikaichuu behavior to detect illusions affecting themselves or the environment. Use **Animal Handling** instead of **Intelligence** for the **genjutsu notice check**, without accuracy bonuses. Success reveals the illusion, but **Kai** or another method is needed to cancel it. Checks start from the **second turn** under the illusion.
    - **Hide Insects**: Kikaichuu can be hidden in the environment for surprise or **Sneak Attacks**, using **Animal Handling** instead of **Stealth**. In heavy vegetation, **Sciences** can be used instead.
    - **Drain Poison**: Use 1 kikaichuu to drain poison from a creature’s body. While concentrating, make a **Animal Handling** or **Medicine (First Aid)** check each turn against the poison’s resistance DC. Each success grants the victim an **automatic success** on their poison resistance check. Once all poison is drained, the kikaichuu dies. This leaves the user **flat-footed** unless they have the **Medical Ninja** feat.

---
### SHŌKAICHUU (TRACKER PARASITE INSECT)

- **Prerequisites**: Animal Handling 6, Kikaichuu
- **Benefit**: The character can control **shōkaichuu**, larva-like insects capable of burrowing through earth to locate chakra signatures and report their positions to the host.
    - **Quantity**: 1 group of 100 shōkaichuu per **Animal Handling** level, additive to other insect types.
    - **Usage**:
        - **Release**: Releasing any number of shōkaichuu is a **free action**.
        - **Track**: Commanding shōkaichuu to begin tracking is a **standard action** with **no chakra cost**. Each group covers a **20m radius** area. By the start of the **fifth turn**, the insects return, reporting the positions of all creatures with chakra signatures in the area.
        - Other actions follow **Kikaichuu** rules, except shōkaichuu **cannot attack**.

---
### KIDAICHUU (GIANT PARASITE INSECT)

- **Prerequisites**: Animal Handling 12, Kikaichuu
- **Benefit**: The character controls **kidaichuu**, beetle-like insects that aggressively drain chakra and grow massively while feeding. Their usage rules are similar to **Kikaichuu**, but they consume chakra more violently and increase in size. Due to difficulty in breeding, fewer kidaichuu are hosted.
    - **Restriction**: Cannot have **Kidaichuu** and **Rinkaichuu** simultaneously.
    - **Quantity**: 1 kidaichuu per **3 full levels of Animal Handling**, additive to other insect types.
    - **Usage**:
        - Kidaichuu **cannot fly**.
        - To use, the user must **touch the target** (requires a **Melee Combat (MC)** check) to place kidaichuu on them. All available kidaichuu can be placed with one touch.
        - Each kidaichuu drains **2 chakra points** per attack, growing to **Standard size** by the end of the turn. The first attack (upon placement) does not drain chakra again.
        - After growing, kidaichuu act as **partner minions** with the following stats:
            - **Attack**: Bite with **0 weapon damage**, draining **2 chakra points** per attack. Use the Aburame’s **Ranged Combat (RC)** accuracy for MC checks. Multiple kidaichuu attacking in one turn use a **single attack roll** (target defends once).
            - **Defense**: Dodge, using the Aburame’s **Anticipate Movement (AM)** for dodge checks.
            - **Attributes**: Strength and Dexterity = **Animal Handling level - 2**; other attributes = **half that value**.
            - **Skills**: Out of combat, use attributes for accuracy. In combat, kidaichuu **automatically fail** skill checks.
            - **Hit Points**: **2x Animal Handling level**.
            - **Chakra**: Equal to chakra drained from targets.
        - The user spends **no chakra** for kidaichuu attacks, and drained chakra is consumed by the insects.
        - Other parameters follow standard rules.


#### EXAMPLE KIDAICHUU SHEET (CAMPAIGN LEVEL 12)

### RINKAICHUU (POISONOUS PARASITE INSECT)

- **Prerequisites**: Animal Handling 12, Kikaichuu
- **Benefit**: The character can control **rinkaichuu**, near-microscopic, highly venomous insects that destroy enemy cells, causing immense pain. Each group of rinkaichuu contains thousands of insects.
    - **Appearance and Containment**: The Aburame’s clothing prevents rinkaichuu from escaping. Users typically wear gloves and full-body attire, removing them in combat to reveal purple skin covered with insects. Once released, rinkaichuu bypass target clothing to reach their skin.
    - **Quantity**: 1 group of rinkaichuu per **Animal Handling** level, additive to other insect types. Lost or transferred rinkaichuu regenerate up to **half the total** after **1 turn** via rapid multiplication.
    - **Usage**:
        - Unlike **Kikaichuu**, rinkaichuu **cannot fly** and require **direct skin contact** with the target to transfer. They are typically concentrated in the torso but can spread across the body as a **reaction** at the start of combat.
        - A quick touch transfers **1 rinkaichuu group**. Using **Multiattack**, 1 group is transferred per successful attack. Sustained contact for **1 full turn** allows transfer of any number of groups.
        - **Involuntary Transfer**: When the Aburame is touched, rinkaichuu automatically transfer to the creature making contact.
    - **Cellular Destruction**: Once on the target, rinkaichuu act like viruses, multiplying rapidly on the skin. The target takes **fixed damage per turn equal to 1 per rinkaichuu group** infecting them. Due to intense pain, the target must pass a **Vigor Check (DC 7 + Handle Animals)** or become **stunned** for **1 turn** and **fatigued** until treated. The check is repeated each time more rinkaichuu are added. **Fatigued** condition only stacks with non-rinkaichuu sources.
        - If HP reaches **0**, rinkaichuu damage cannot reduce it further, but the target becomes **paralyzed** and cannot recover HP until all rinkaichuu are removed.
    - **Treatment**: Two methods to remove rinkaichuu:
        - **Aburame Removal**: The Aburame owner touches the target for **1 turn** to recall the insects.
        - **Medical Treatment**: Create an antidote with **Medicine and Occultism 14** (reduced to 12 for Konoha characters), following **poison creation rules**. The victim must take the antidote for **3 days** to kill all rinkaichuu.
    - **Natural Antibodies**: Rinkaichuu protect the user against viral and bacterial diseases, granting **Greater Resistance (Vigor)** benefits for related checks.
    - **Restriction**: Cannot have **Kidaichuu** and **Rinkaichuu** simultaneously.

## RESTRICTED POWERS

### KIKAI NINPOU

The **Aburame Clan** character can purchase the restricted power **Kikai Ninpou**, which involves techniques for manipulating **Kikaichuu** insects. This power is exclusive to **Kikaichuu** and cannot be used with other insect types.

- **Purchase**: Kikai Ninpou is bought as a version of the generic **Ninpou** power, following its rules for damage, range, and size.
- **Prerequisite**: Kikaichuu (feat)
- **Key Skill**: Animal Handling (replaces Spirit for calculating range, damage, and resistance check DC).


#### GENERAL RULES

- **Insect Usage**: Each Kikai Ninpou technique uses **1 Kikaichuu per power level**. Used insects move to attack the target and return to the user as a **free action**.
- **Chakra Drain**: Techniques drain **1 chakra point per power level** upon contact. For effects with a chakra cost, the drain is divided across multiple attacks (if applicable). Effects causing **damage over time** drain **half the chakra per turn** (rounded down).
- **Range**: Medium (**10m + 2m per Handle Animals level**). Insects can only be manipulated within this range.
- **Size**: Creations, manipulations, or areas of effect can have up to **1m diameter, length, width, or height per Animal Handling level**.
- **Disperse Insects**: If a Kikai Ninpou creation is attacked, spend a **movement action** and make an **Anticipate Movement** check as a defensive action. Success disperses the insects just before the attack, preventing their destruction. Return them to the body as a **free action** or leave them in place.
- **Allowed Effects**: Cannon, Orb, Ray, Barrier, Arrows, Ricochet, Column, Cloud, Destructive Breath, Missile.
- **Exclusive Effect**: Interference (see below).


#### LEVEL 3 EFFECT: INTERFERENCE

- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: 1m
- **Area of Effect**: Circle with **30m diameter + 3m per Handle Animals level**, with standard power height.
- **Duration**: Sustained
- **Description**: Spread **1 Kikaichuu** across the area to emit chakra signals that confuse sensor ninjas. Creatures using the **Sensor** feat (including ground-limited sensors) must make a **Track Check** (DC based on Kikai Ninpou’s standard DC). Failure causes interference, detecting multiple false chakra signatures, preventing differentiation of real ones.
