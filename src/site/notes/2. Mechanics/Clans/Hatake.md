The **Hatake Clan** is a small but significant clan in Konoha, renowned for producing exceptional ninjas with remarkable abilities. The clan has two defining traits: a summoning contract with Konoha's **Ninja Dogs** and the **White Chakra Blade**.

**Hijutsu Options**:

- **Option 1**: Restricted Kuchiyose: Dogs.
- **Option 2**: Tensai and Silver Fang. With this option, you can still purchase **Kuchiyose** as a common power.
