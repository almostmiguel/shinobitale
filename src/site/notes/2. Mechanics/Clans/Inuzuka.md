The **Inuzuka Clan** is distinguished by its strong affinity with animals, particularly dogs and wolves. Every Inuzuka child receives a canine companion at a young age, which becomes an inseparable ally in missions and combat. The clan's special ability allows members to channel chakra into their noses, enhancing their olfactory senses to superhuman levels.

**Restricted Feats**: Animal Companion, Hakken no Jutsu  
**Restricted Power**: Shikakyu (Quadruped)

The Inuzuka’s bond with canines and lupines has led to techniques that enhance their olfactory capabilities and mimic canine fighting styles.
