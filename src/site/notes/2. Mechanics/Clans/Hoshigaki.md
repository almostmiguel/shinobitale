The **Hoshigaki Clan** is a shinobi clan from **Kirigakure**. All members share shark-like traits, such as sharp, pointed teeth and facial markings resembling gills. Their appearance alone signals their expertise in **Suiton** techniques, making them deadly in areas with large amounts of water.

**Restricted Feats**: Chakra Expansion, Aquatic Predator, Natural Element: Suiton, Water Reserve.

**Exclusive Summoning**: Shark (**Kuchiyose** as a Common Power).

## RESTRICTED FEATS
### AQUATIC PREDATOR
**Benefit:** Your skin is thick and covered in tough scales, and you have gills and rows of sharp teeth. You can breathe underwater and move at **double your normal speed** in water. Your special skin grants **Body Hardness 1** against all armed and unarmed attacks. At **Vigor 8**, this increases to **Body Hardness 2**, and at **Vigor  12**, it becomes **Body Hardness 3**.

### NATURAL ELEMENT: SUITON
Your biological affinity with ocean predators makes you exceptionally skilled in **Suiton** techniques.

**Prerequisites:** Aquatic Predator, Suiton 1.

**Benefit:** All **Suiton** effects gain **+2 base damage** as an elemental bonus (similar to additional damage from Katon, for example).

### WATER RESERVE
**Prerequisites:** Suiton 5, Spirit 9, Water Mastery, Natural Element: Suiton.

**Benefit:** You can project water with extreme ease. When using the **Water Mastery** feat, you accumulate **double the possible water points.** All other **Water Mastery** rules remain unchanged.

## SUITON: EFFECTS FOR HOSHIGAKI
Purchasing the Hoshigaki Clan's restricted feats grants access to new **Suiton** effects.

### LEVEL 10 EFFECT: SHARK PRISON
- **Prerequisites:** Water Prison Level 9, Wave Collision Level 8, Aquatic Predator, Natural Element: Suiton, Water Reserve.
- **Action:** Full
- **Area of Effect:** Sphere with **double the standard size** of the power.
- **Duration:** Sustained

You create a massive water dome around yourself, trapping everyone within its area of effect. Using **Shark Prison** requires a **Ranged Combat (RC)** check against the target's **Evade** or another defense that allows escaping the area. If no such defense or sufficient movement is available, it's an **automatic success**.

The dome has **zero hardness** and **absorption equal to 6 per level of the power used.** Trapped victims must make **Athletics (Swimming)** checks (standard DC) to escape or **Vigor** tests (standard DC -2) to hold their breath. Failure results in suffocation.

Whenever a victim moves within the prison, you can immediately spend a **movement action** to move in the same direction, dragging the entire water dome with you to prevent their escape. If multiple targets move in different directions simultaneously, you can only pursue one direction.
