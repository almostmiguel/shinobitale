The **Akimichi Clan** is one of Konoha's noble clans, known for their immense physical strength and ability to rapidly convert calories into chakra for their secret techniques. These techniques quickly consume chakra, making prolonged battles taxing, so Akimichi maintain high chakra reserves by consuming large amounts of food to build or replenish calories. Their clothing bears the kanji for "food" (食, _shoku_) as a tribute. In dire situations, they can use the clan's **Three Colored Pills** to convert excess fat into chakra at the cost of their health. Many Akimichi wield the **bō (staff)** as their weapon. Their **Hijutsu** allows them to expand their body, either partially or fully.

**Restricted Feats**: Corpulence, Resilience  
**Restricted Power**: Baika Ninpou (Ninja Art of Expansion)

## RESTRICTED POWERS

### BAIKA NINPOU

The **Akimichi Clan** character can purchase the restricted power **Baika Ninpou**, gaining access to the following techniques based on the power level. This power focuses on body expansion, leveraging the clan’s ability to convert calories into chakra.

- **Prerequisite**: Vigor 6, Corpulence (feat)


#### LEVEL 1: BAIKA NO JUTSU (EXPANSION TECHNIQUE)

- **Type**: Ninjutsu / Akimichi Hijutsu
- **Action**: Movement
- **Range**: Personal
- **Duration**: Continuous
- **Chakra Cost**: Varies (see below)
- **Description**: The user freely alters their size. At lower levels, they expand their abdominal section, becoming rotund, ideal for **Nikudan Sensha**. At higher levels, the entire body expands proportionally, turning the user into a giant.
    - **Level 1**: Costs **1 chakra point**, increases abdominal size (rotund) for **Nikudan Sensha** (requires **partial action**, instantaneous duration).
    - **Level 4**: Costs **3 chakra points**, increases full body to **Grand** size category. Items and weapons scale with the body (weapon damage unchanged).
    - **Level 5**: Costs **4 chakra points**, increases full body to **Massive** size category.
    - **Level 6**: Costs **5 chakra points**, increases full body to **Vast** size category.

- **Prerequisite**: Fighter (Aptitude)
- **Action**: Full
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Chakra Cost**: 1
- **Description**: A threatening Taijutsu that turns the user’s large body into a destructive weapon. After using **Baika no Jutsu** (paying its chakra cost) to become a human-sized ball, the user propels forward with chakra, spinning like a compressor roller. The rotation burns the hands of anyone touching the user, and the user is **immune to sonic effects** during the technique.
    - Functions as a **charge trample action**, dealing damage equal to the Akimichi’s standard melee attack.
    - The target makes a **Vigor Check (DC 2 + user’s MC)** to avoid being knocked **prone**.
- **Variation: Nikudan Hari Sensha (Spiked Human Tank)**
    - Wraps a chain of kunais around the body (**partial action**) to add **slashing** damage.
    - Alternatively, spend **1 chakra point** to make hair grow sharp (**free action**), reducing preparation time.

- **Type**: Ninjutsu / Akimichi Hijutsu
- **Prerequisite**: Brawler (Feat)
- **Action**: Free
- **Range**: Personal
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Description**: A practical application of **Baika no Jutsu**, expanding one or both arms or legs to increase the power of physical attacks. The sudden expansion makes attacks hard to avoid.
    - Used before an attack, special maneuver, or maneuver aptitude, increasing the chosen limb(s) to **Grand** size, granting **2m MC reach** and **+1 Strength**.
    - Grants **+1 accuracy** on **trample**, **push**, **grapple**, and **takedown** tests (non-cumulative with other maneuver bonuses).

### CALORY CONTROL

Akimichi can store chakra as calories, burning them for powerful effects at the cost of health risks.

- **Duration**: Sustained (or **3 turns** continuous with pills).
