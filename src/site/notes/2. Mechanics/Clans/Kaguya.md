## SHIKOTSUMYAKU (DEAD BONE PULSE)

### BONE CRAFTSMAN

- **Benefit**: Remove and shape bones from your body to create various weapons, with near-instant bone regeneration making you a living arsenal.
    - **Creation Process**: Removing bones (typically from an arm) renders that limb unusable until the start of your next turn as bones regrow. You are proficient with all bone weapons (no need for **Weapon Training** feat). Only **Shikotsumyaku** users are proficient with these **Special Weapons**.
    - **Weapon Creation**: Can create **light, medium, long, or heavy weapons** of slashing or piercing type, meeting **Strength** and **Dexterity** requirements. Cannot create mechanically complex or chemical-dependent weapons. Weapons last **1 scene**.
        - **Light Weapons**: **Partial action**, **1 HP** per weapon.
        - **Medium Weapons**: **Partial action**, **2 HP** per weapon.
        - **Long/Heavy Weapons**: **Movement action**, **4 HP** per weapon.
        - Costs apply to special **Shikotsumyaku** weapons. Not affected by **Quick Draw** feat.
    - **Weapon Quality**: Same properties and damage as standard weapons, but with **+2 hardness** and **+1 weapon damage**. Can block projectile techniques.
    - **Teshi Sendan (Ten-Finger Drilling Bullets)**: Spend **1 HP** to fire bone projectiles from fingers (**standard action**, **20m range**, **base damage = Dexterity level**). Bones regenerate instantly.
    - **Bone Traps**: Special light weapon; long, pointed bones extend from one or both palms (**damage as chosen light weapon**). Can be retracted as a **free action**. Cannot be disarmed, and the limb remains usable. Cannot create other weapons while wielding.
    - **Shikotsumyaku Specialist**: If **Specialist** feat is chosen for **Shikotsumyaku**, its benefits apply to all bone weapons.

### BONE ARMOR

- **Benefit**: An endoskeleton beneath the skin grants **body hardness 1** against all damage types, **Hard to Kill** feat for free, and **fracture immunity**.
    - At **Vigor 10**: Hardness increases to **2**.
    - At **Vigor 14**: Hardness increases to **3**.

    - **Effect**: On success, gain **extra body hardness = Vigor level** until the end of the attacker’s turn (cumulative with **Bone Armor**). Bones protrude to absorb damage.
    - **Counterattack**: Unarmed attackers take **fixed damage = Vigor level** if the defense succeeds, even if hardness is overcome.
    - **Grapple Defense**: Gain **+2 accuracy** against unarmed grapple attempts. Success deals damage and grants a **reaction Strength check** to escape per grapple rules.
