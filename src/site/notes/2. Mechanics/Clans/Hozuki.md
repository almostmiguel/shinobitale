The **Hōzuki Clan** hails from the Hidden Mist Village and is renowned for its unique ability to transform their bodies into a liquid state using **Suika no Jutsu (Hydrification Technique)**. This highly versatile technique grants both offensive power and resilience, though it requires the user to stay more hydrated than average, consuming larger amounts of water. By liquefying their entire body—down to individual hairs, skin, and muscles—the user becomes nearly immune to physical attacks. This ability is invaluable for dodging attacks, infiltrating structures, launching surprise attacks, or reshaping body parts for various purposes.

## RESTRICTED FEATS

### SUIKA

- **Prerequisites**: Suiton 4, Spirit 9
- **Benefit**: Permanently transform your body and clothes into water, as long as you have chakra.
    - **Suika Points (SP)**: Gain a new parameter equal to **3 × Vigor**. Deduct damage from **SP** instead of **HP**. If **SP** reaches 0, remaining damage affects **HP**.
    - **Fluid Immunity**:
        - Immune to **Suiton** technique damage (but not secondary effects like knockback).
        - Immune to **suffocation** from drowning.
        - Take **half base damage** from **Katon** techniques and fire-based damage (e.g., explosive tags).
        - Take **double damage** from **Raiton** techniques and electric damage.
    - **Fluid Escape**: As a **standard action**, liquefy to instantly escape physical restraints (e.g., ropes, cells, **grapple** maneuver) without checks, returning to normal afterward.
    - **Free Effect**: Gain **Emerge Level 2 (Suiton)** at no cost.
    - **Fluid Power**: Use **SP** to pay **Suiton** technique chakra costs (1 SP per chakra point). If the full cost is paid with **SP**, the technique gains **+2 damage** (incompatible with **Water Mastery** feat or **Energize** effect).
    - **Water Pistol**: When using **Cannon (Suiton)**, fire small projectiles from the index finger without hand signs, acting like a firearm.
    - **Hydration**: Recover **5 SP + 2 per Vigor level** with a full night’s rest. The Game Master may reduce or prevent recovery without access to potable water.
    - **Element Restriction**: Cannot use elemental powers other than **Suiton**.
    - **Time Restriction**: **Suika** benefits are unaffected by **Accelerated Technique**.

    - **Escape**: The target must deal **any damage** to the bubble (**absorption 1**, **hardness** per power, follows **Suika Fluid Immunity** rules).
    - **Alternate Use**: As a **prepared action** after a successful **unarmed block**, envelop the target’s head with the bubble upon contact.

    - **Heating**: Upon reaching **Immense** size, internal vapor reaches critical temperature, causing an explosion at the round’s start.
    - **Explosion**: A spherical blast (**standard power size**) deals **base damage + 2**. The user is immune due to **Suika**.
    - **Cooling**: Post-explosion, vapor rises, cools into hail, and falls to reform the clone at its original size, restarting the cycle.
    - **Stats**: Follows **Mizu Bunshin** rules, but is **accelerated** (fast). Attacks only with melee using a large axe (**weapon damage +5**) formed from its arm. If the user has **Water Arm** or **Energize (Suiton)**, use **Spirit** for melee damage.
        - **Vitality**: **3 × Spirit level**.
        - Immune to standard armed/unarmed attack damage (non-chakra or non-Hijutsu).
