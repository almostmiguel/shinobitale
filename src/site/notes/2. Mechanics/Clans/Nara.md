### KAGEJUTSU (SHADOW ART)

The Nara Clan character can purchase the restricted power **Kagejutsu**, gaining the following techniques based on the power level.

#### LEVEL 1: KAGE SHIBARI NO JUTSU (SHADOW BINDING TECHNIQUE)

- **Type**: Ninjutsu / Hijutsu
- **Action**: Standard
- **Target**: 1 or more living creatures (see text)
- **Range**: Short (**5m + 2m per power level**)
- **Duration**: Concentration (see text)
- **Chakra Cost**: 1 per power level
- **Description**: Extends the user’s shadow across any surface (including water) within range. When it connects with a target’s shadow, the target is instantly **paralyzed**.
    - **Usage**: Requires a **Ranged Combat (RC)** check against the target’s defense. On success, the target is paralyzed for the technique’s duration. The user must remain **immobile and concentrated**, or the technique ends.
    - **Silent Technique**: If used from **stealth**, behind cover, or as a **sneak attack**, the target takes **-3 to Dodge and Anticipate Movement** defenses and cannot use other defenses.
    - **Slow Technique**: If the target sees the technique, the user takes **-3 accuracy** on **RC** checks.
    - **Resistance Check**: The target can use a **standard action** to make a **Strength check (DC 9 + Power Level + Intelligence ÷ 2, rounded up)** to escape. This applies to all **Kagejutsu** techniques.
    - **Range Modifiers**:
        - **+1m per power level** under sunrise/sunset or a flash bomb’s light.
        - **-1m per power level** under midday sun.
        - Cannot be used in **total darkness**.
        - **+1m range per object shadow** used to extend the shadow’s path.
    - **Duration**: Concentration, up to **1 + 1 turn per power level (max 6 turns)**. Each reuse in the same scene reduces duration by 1 (minimum 2 turns). The technique ends after the last turn. These duration rules apply to **Kage Mane** as well.
    - **Multiple Targets**: Can split the shadow into filaments to bind **1 target per 2 power levels** (max). Duration is **2 turns** for multiple targets. Against **minions**, duration doubles.
    - **Impaired, Prone, or Winged Targets**:
        - Cannot use **Anticipate Movement**.
        - **Dodge** is fixed at **9**.
        - Prone/winged conditions do not affect accuracy or range.

- **Kage Shibari Kage Mane no Jutsu (Requires Level 4)**: You can pass your technique through the shadow of an ally to extend its range without impairing your allies movements, and force a captured target to mimic your movements.

#### LEVEL 2: KAGE MANE NO JUTSU (SHADOW IMITATION TECHNIQUE)

- **Type**: Ninjutsu / Hijutsu
- **Action**: Standard
- **Target**: 1 or more living creatures
- **Range**: Short (**5m + 2m per power level**)
- **Duration**: Concentration
- **Chakra Cost**: 1 per power level
- **Description**: An advanced **Kage Shibari**, forcing captured targets to mimic the user’s movements.
    - Follows **Kage Shibari** rules with these differences:
        - **Movement Imitation**: The user can move normally, and the target must mimic direction, distance, and speed. The technique ends if the user moves beyond the technique’s range.
        - **Gesture Imitation**: Targets mimic the user’s actions (e.g., moving left hand, picking up objects within reach). Perfect imitation requires a **humanoid (bipedal, two arms, two legs)** target; non-humanoids only mimic movement. Imitations do not consume the target’s actions.
        - **Flying Targets**: Immediately fall and mimic movement as possible.
    - **Prepared Shadow (Requires Level 7)**: After missing, sustain the technique and reuse it once as a **standard action** without seals, paying chakra cost again and restarting duration. If reused at **melee range (1m)**, it’s silent, with **-3 to target’s Dodge** and no other defenses allowed.
    - **Guided Shadow (Requires Level 8)**: Connect to an ally’s shadow with a weak link, allowing free movement (requires concentration). If the ally’s shadow touches an enemy’s (within 1m), pay chakra cost to activate **Kage Mane** with **Silent Technique** benefits. Duration starts upon activation.
    - **Perfect Shadow (Requires Level 9)**: Duration becomes **sustained**.

#### LEVEL 3: KAGE MANE SHURIKEN NO JUTSU (SHADOW IMITATION SHURIKEN TECHNIQUE)

- **Type**: Ninjutsu / Hijutsu
- **Action**: Partial (preparation)
- **Range**: Short (**5m + 2m per power level**)
- **Duration**: Concentration (max 2 turns)
- **Chakra Cost**: 1 per power level
- **Description**: Requires a chakra-conductive projectile weapon (e.g., **Iron Knuckle**).
    - **Usage**: With a **partial action** (plus drawing the weapon), infuse **Kage Mane** into the weapon. Throw it at the target’s shadow (**standard action**) to pin it to the ground. If the target is unaware of the intent, they take **-2 to Dodge and Anticipate Movement**.
    - **Effect**: On success, the target is **paralyzed** per **Kage Shibari** rules (concentration, max 2 turns).
    - **Free Kage Mane**: While the target is paralyzed, apply **Kage Mane** as a **free action**, paying its chakra cost.

#### LEVEL 5: KAGE KUBISHIBARI NO JUTSU (SHADOW STRANGULATION TECHNIQUE)

- **Type**: Ninjutsu / Hijutsu
- **Action**: Movement
- **Target**: Creature captured by **Kage Mane** or **Kage Shibari**
- **Duration**: Same as **Kage Mane** or **Kage Shibari**
- **Chakra Cost**: 1 per power level
- **Description**: Strangles targets captured by **Kage Mane** or **Kage Shibari**, targeting **1 creature per 6 Spirit points**.
    - **Usage**: With a **movement action**, transform **Kage Mane/Shibari** into **Kage Kubishibari**, maintaining duration and concentration. At the end of each user’s turn, deal **fixed suffocation damage = Power Level + (Intelligence ÷ 2)**, ignoring breath-holding.
    - **Resistance**: Targets use a **standard action** for a **Strength check** to escape **Kage Kubishibari**. If successful, they remain bound by **Kage Mane/Shibari** and must escape separately. Use respective levels for difficulty if used at different power levels.
    - **Aftermath**: Freed targets are **fatigued** until the end of their next turn.

#### LEVEL 6: KAGEYOSE NO JUTSU (SHADOW COLLECTION TECHNIQUE)

- **Type**: Ninjutsu / Hijutsu
- **Action**: Movement
- **Range**: Short (**5m + 2m per power level**)
- **Duration**: Sustained or Concentration (Shackle)
- **Chakra Cost**: 1 per power level
- **Description**: Materializes the shadow into **2 filaments per power level** to handle small objects with dexterity.
    - **Usage**: With a **standard action**, gather all filaments to one point, retrieving held objects (e.g., kunai, explosive tags).
    - **Throw Projectile**: Use **Ranged Combat** accuracy to throw held projectiles.
    - **Shadow Shackle**: Bind a target with shadows (**1 target per 2 filaments**) using **Ninpou’s Shackle Level 6** rules. **Hardness = Power Level + (Intelligence ÷ 2)**. Resistance difficulty matches **Kage Mane**.

#### LEVEL 6: KAGE NUI (SHADOW STITCHING)

- **Type**: Ninjutsu / Hijutsu
- **Action**: Standard (or Full, see text)
- **Target**: One or more creatures
- **Duration**: Instantaneous (or Sustained/Concentration, see text)
- **Chakra Cost**: 1 per power level
- **Description**: Forms **2 filaments per power level** into needle-like shadows to pierce and/or bind targets.
    - **Usage**: Same filament count and range as **Kageyose**. Each needle deals **1 base damage**, following **Kage Mane** rules but without the **slow technique** penalty.
    - **Stitching**: With a **full action** and a **degree of damage 3+**, bind the target (**sustained duration**, per **Shadow Shackle** rules). Any degree of damage with a second use paralyzes the target (**concentration duration**). Targets cannot use **Escape** proficiency to break free.
    - **Escape**: A successful **Strength check** or other method frees the target from all conditions (even if applied twice).

#### LEVEL 8: KAGEZUKAMI NO JUTSU (SHADOW CAPTURE TECHNIQUE)

- **Type**: Ninjutsu / Hijutsu
- **Action**: Standard
- **Target**: One or more creatures
- **Duration**: Concentration
