## RESTRICTED FEATS
### NATURAL ELEMENT: KATON
"An Uchiha is only recognized as such when they can perform Katon: Goukakyuu no Jutsu."

**Prerequisite:** Spirit Level 1

**Benefit:** You can use the **Destructive Breath 4** effect for **Katon**, even without the Katon power and even at Genin level (CL 4). The effect's base damage is **Spirit + 2** (due to Katon's elemental bonus). The chakra cost is **half your Spirit level** (rounded up). Other rules for the effect, such as range and size, follow the **Katon** power's standard rules.

If you purchase the **Katon** power, you gain **Destructive Breath** at level 5 in addition to another effect you're entitled to choose. **Destructive Breath** also automatically upgrades at levels 7 and 10 without needing to be selected, following the power's standard rules. This feat can be used by a **True Clone** and does not count toward the **elemental affinity limit**.

### SHARINGAN
The **Sharingan** is a powerful doujutsu exclusive to the Uchiha Clan, often awakening during intense battles where visual perception is critical. At this stage, it appears incomplete, with a single black comma on a red iris.

**Prerequisite:** Perception 3

**Benefit:** Activating the Sharingan requires a **partial action** and **1 chakra point**. It lasts for an entire scene (continuous duration) and can be activated during a defense. While active, the Sharingan grants:
- **Chakra Vision:** You can distinguish chakra by color, identifying when an opponent uses a jutsu, no matter how subtle. You can also detect if someone is trapped in a genjutsu or if a jutsu affects a specific area or creature. You cannot see through chakra-based creations (e.g., **Suiton's Mist** effect) or physical cover/camouflage.
- **Measure Power:** By observing a creature's chakra, you can estimate their approximate strength (i.e., their character sheet level).
- **Distinguish Chakra:** You can differentiate creatures by their unique chakra signatures.
- **Perceptive Dodge:** You can use **Anticipate Movement (AM)** instead of **Dodge (DOD)** for defense calculations, making the attacker's DC 9 + your LM accuracy. All standard dodge rules, benefits and penalties apply. You can use dodge bonuses (e.g., from the **Reflexes** feat) with this ability but cannot apply **Read Movement** accuracy bonuses (e.g., from the **Insight** feat)

### NIDAN SHARINGAN
At this stage, the Uchiha gains greater mastery over their Kekkei Genkai, with the red iris now displaying two black commas.

**Prerequisites:** Perception Level 6, Sharingan

**Benefit:** When using the **Sharingan** feat, you gain the following additional benefits:
- **Accelerated Vision:** You gain the benefits of the **Insight** feat for free and a +2 bonus to **Notice** against the **Feint** maneuver.
- **Enhanced Focus:** You react to a focused target as effectively as one at the edge of your vision, making you immune to being **flanked**.
- **Hypnotic Gaze:** You can cast genjutsu on a target by maintaining eye contact, without needing hand seals or gestures. The range is **9 meters**, and no **Focus** test is required in close combat.
	- **Fascinate:** You can use the **Fascinate** feat via eye contact with a **+1 increase to the DC**. It can be used multiple times on the same target in a scene, with the target gaining **1 turn off immunity** after breaking free. You must still purchase the **Fascinate** feat to use it with these benefits.
	- **Eye-to-Eye Contact:** It's assumed the enemy maintains sufficient eye contact for the **Hypnotic Gaze** unless they explicitly avoid looking at your face. Avoiding eye contact imposes penalties equivalent to **partial camouflage,** unless they have **Blind Fighting level 2**.
- **Illusion Resistance:** You gain a **+2 bonus** to resistance tests against enemy ocular genjutsu.
- **Sharingan Mimicry:** You gain access to **Sharingan Mimicry** techniques.

### SANDAN SHARINGAN
The most mature stage of the Sharingan, marked by a third black comma, signifying complete mastery. Uchiha who reach this level often become prominent in their community.

**Prerequisites:** Perception Level 9, Nidan Sharingan

**Benefit:** When using the **Sharingan** aptitude, you gain the following additional benefits:
- **Sharingan Genjutsu:** You gain access to exclusive **Sharingan Hypnosis** illusion techniques.
- **Greater Accelerated Vision:** You become immune to **accelerated feints** (see **accelerated** condition) and can perform **opportunistic attacks** against accelerated enemies.
- **Perfect Prediction:** You can use all **prediction maneuvers** during **opportunistic atacks** or when **flat-footed**. You can also use **Overcome Technique** without an accuracy penalty.
- **Illusion Reversal:** With a **standard action**, you can use **Perception** instead of **Intelligence** to detect an enemy illusion. If successful, you reverse the illusion back to its caster via **Hypnotic Gaze**, forcing them to resist it while you remain unaffected. This requires spending the **same amount of chakra** as the illusion and being within **9 meters** of the enemy. This works against any illusion targeting only you, including **Hijutsu**, except **Tsukuyomi**.
