One of Konoha's most renowned clans, the **Uchiha Clan** is responsible for the village's protection and security, forming a core part of its policing force. Their **kekkei genkai**, the **Sharingan**, is both famous and coveted beyond the Land of Fire due to its immense power.

**Restricted Feats**: Natural Element: Katon, Sharingan, Nidan Sharingan, Sandan Sharingan, Mangekyou Sharingan  
**Element Requirement**: You must have the **Katon** power or the **Natural Element: Katon** feat from character creation.

## RESTRICTED FEATS

### NATURAL ELEMENT: KATON
"An Uchiha is only recognized as such when they can perform Katon: Goukakyuu no Jutsu."

**Prerequisite:** Spirit Level 1

**Benefit:** You can use the **Destructive Breath 4** effect for **Katon**, even without the Katon power and even at Genin level (CL 4). The effect's base damage is **Spirit + 2** (due to Katon's elemental bonus). The chakra cost is **half your Spirit level** (rounded up). Other rules for the effect, such as range and size, follow the **Katon** power's standard rules.

If you purchase the **Katon** power, you gain **Destructive Breath** at level 5 in addition to another effect you're entitled to choose. **Destructive Breath** also automatically upgrades at levels 7 and 10 without needing to be selected, following the power's standard rules. This feat can be used by a **True Clone** and does not count toward the **elemental affinity limit**.

### SHARINGAN
The **Sharingan** is a powerful doujutsu exclusive to the Uchiha Clan, often awakening during intense battles where visual perception is critical. At this stage, it appears incomplete, with a single black comma on a red iris.

**Prerequisite:** Perception 3, Lore Awakening

**Benefit:** Activating the Sharingan requires a **partial action** and **1 chakra point**. It lasts for an entire scene (continuous duration) and can be activated during a defense. While active, the Sharingan grants:
- **Chakra Vision:** You can distinguish chakra by color, identifying when an opponent uses a jutsu, no matter how subtle. You can also detect if someone is trapped in a genjutsu or if a jutsu affects a specific area or creature. You cannot see through chakra-based creations (e.g., **Suiton's Mist** effect) or physical cover/camouflage.
- **Measure Power:** By observing a creature's chakra, you can estimate their approximate strength (i.e., their character sheet level).
- **Distinguish Chakra:** You can differentiate creatures by their unique chakra signatures.
- **Perceptive Dodge:** You can use **Anticipate Movement (AM)** instead of **Dodge (DOD)** for defense calculations, making the attacker's DC 9 + your LM accuracy. All standard dodge rules, benefits and penalties apply. You can use dodge bonuses (e.g., from the **Reflexes** feat) with this ability but cannot apply **Read Movement** accuracy bonuses (e.g., from the **Insight** feat)

### NIDAN SHARINGAN
At this stage, the Uchiha gains greater mastery over their Kekkei Genkai, with the red iris now displaying two black commas.

**Prerequisites:** Perception Level 6, Sharingan

**Benefit:** When using the **Sharingan** feat, you gain the following additional benefits:
- **Accelerated Vision:** You gain the benefits of the **Insight** feat for free and a +2 bonus to **Notice** against the **Feint** maneuver.
- **Enhanced Focus:** You react to a focused target as effectively as one at the edge of your vision, making you immune to being **flanked**.
- **Hypnotic Gaze:** You can cast genjutsu on a target by maintaining eye contact, without needing hand seals or gestures. The range is **9 meters**, and no **Focus** test is required in close combat.
	- **Fascinate:** You can use the **Fascinate** feat via eye contact with a **+1 increase to the DC**. It can be used multiple times on the same target in a scene, with the target gaining **1 turn off immunity** after breaking free. You must still purchase the **Fascinate** feat to use it with these benefits.
	- **Eye-to-Eye Contact:** It's assumed the enemy maintains sufficient eye contact for the **Hypnotic Gaze** unless they explicitly avoid looking at your face. Avoiding eye contact imposes penalties equivalent to **partial camouflage,** unless they have **Blind Fighting level 2**.
- **Illusion Resistance:** You gain a **+2 bonus** to resistance tests against enemy ocular genjutsu.
- **Sharingan Mimicry:** You gain access to **Sharingan Mimicry** techniques.

### SANDAN SHARINGAN
The most mature stage of the Sharingan, marked by a third black comma, signifying complete mastery. Uchiha who reach this level often become prominent in their community.

**Prerequisites:** Perception Level 9, Nidan Sharingan

**Benefit:** When using the **Sharingan** aptitude, you gain the following additional benefits:
- **Sharingan Genjutsu:** You gain access to exclusive **Sharingan Hypnosis** illusion techniques.
- **Greater Accelerated Vision:** You become immune to **accelerated feints** (see **accelerated** condition) and can perform **opportunistic attacks** against accelerated enemies.
- **Perfect Prediction:** You can use all **prediction maneuvers** during **opportunistic atacks** or when **flat-footed**. You can also use **Overcome Technique** without an accuracy penalty.
- **Illusion Reversal:** With a **standard action**, you can use **Perception** instead of **Intelligence** to detect an enemy illusion. If successful, you reverse the illusion back to its caster via **Hypnotic Gaze**, forcing them to resist it while you remain unaffected. This requires spending the **same amount of chakra** as the illusion and being within **9 meters** of the enemy. This works against any illusion targeting only you, including **Hijutsu**, except **Tsukuyomi**.

## RESTRICTED TECHNIQUE

#### SHARINGAN MIMICRY

- **Type**: Ninjutsu / Kekkei Genkai, Doujutsu
- **Prerequisites**: Nidan Sharingan
- **Range**: Personal (see text)
- **Chakra Cost**: Zero (except for Nullify Technique)

The Uchiha can copy, cancel, and memorize techniques observed by emulating hand signs and chakra usage through their synchronized vision.

- **Nullify Technique**: You can use the **Nullify Technique** maneuver without an appropriate counter-technique, copying the opponent’s technique instead, paying its chakra cost.
- **Copy Technique**: You can temporarily learn a technique nullified or analyzed with Sharingan. Analyzing a technique in combat requires a **full action** (no check needed). Announce the intent to study it, spending the action immediately, during any character’s turn.
    - Copied techniques can be used unlimited times for **one week**. You can copy **1 technique per 4 full Intelligence points** (max 5). To copy a new technique beyond this limit, you must forget an old one.
    - Copied techniques retain all parameters (damage, chakra cost, action, duration, etc.) as used during copying, unmodifiable unless the technique allows. Bonuses from restricted feats or powers are not copied.
- **Memorize Technique**: A copied technique can be memorized, no longer counting toward the copy limit and persisting beyond a week. Only **1 technique** can be memorized at a time; memorizing a new one overwrites the old.
    - Optionally, permanently learn a memorized technique for **2 Power Points**, recording it as a feat. Memorized techniques cannot serve as prerequisites for other techniques, powers, or feats.
    - For characters created at **Campaign Level 8+**, the Game Master may allow starting with **1 memorized technique** and any number of permanent techniques.
- **Restrictions**: Sharingan Mimicry can copy:
    - An effect of a power.
    - A shinobi feat.
    - A maneuver feat.
    - Level 1 of any common power.
    - For techniques with evolutions or Ninpou/Element effects, copy the lowest level.
    - Techniques must not be from a **Hijutsu** or **Clan**, must be within the character’s **Power Limit**, and require all prerequisites.
    - You can copy techniques of the five basic elements (**Doton**, **Fuuton**, **Katon**, **Raiton**, **Suiton**) even without the affinity.
- **New Element**: Grants the right to choose, purchase, and develop an additional **elemental ninjutsu power** beyond those already possessed.

#### SHARINGAN HYPNOSIS

- **Type**: Genjutsu / Kekkei Genkai, Doujutsu
- **Prerequisites**: Sandan Sharingan, Fascinate, Deep Illusion
- **Range**: 9m
- **Target**: 1 creature
- **Chakra Cost**: 5
- **Hand Seals**: No

This mental illusion follows the **Magen** power rules but with a modified difficulty (**8 + Intelligence Level**, including Deep Illusion). Using Sharingan, you hypnotize a target who fails an **Intelligence test**. Apply one of the following effects:

- **Gather Information**: (1-round action / continuous duration) The target enters a trance and answers any question they know the answer to.
- **Alter Attitude**: (1-round action / continuous duration) Change a **minion** target’s attitude toward you on any scale.
- **Knockout**: (standard action / instantaneous duration) The target (minion only) falls **unconscious**.
- **Paralyze**: (requires Int 10 / standard action / continuous duration) Creates an illusion of being restrained, as per the **Paralyze** effect of Magen, using the highest effect level allowed by the campaign and corresponding chakra cost.
- **Mind Control**: (standard action / continuous duration) The target’s (minion only) mind falls under your control, allowing you to command all actions.
- **Control Bijuu**: (standard action / permanent duration / NPCs only) Using **Mangekyou Sharingan**, control one **Bijuu**, turning it into your personal summon per **Common Kuchiyose** rules, even without the power.
- **Steal Technique**: (full action / instantaneous duration) Force the target to use their most powerful **Mimicry-eligible technique** on their next action. You copy and use it against them before they complete it, with the target **flat-footed** against it. Pay the **hypnosis cost** plus the stolen technique’s chakra cost.
- **False Death**: (movement action / instantaneous duration) When targeted by an attack or power, apply a genjutsu making the enemy believe the attack succeeded and you died. The enemy cannot resist, their attack is interrupted, and you can escape using your **standard movement**. No tests are made. Usable **once per scene**.
- **Override Genjutsu**: (standard action / instantaneous duration) Free someone from a genjutsu by overlaying another illusion. Requires an **Intelligence test**, functioning like **Kai** but at range with eye-to-eye contact.
