## RESTRICTED FEATS

### BYAKUGAN

The Byakugan is the Hyuuga Clan’s advanced bloodline, renowned across all nations for its exceptional perception and power. When activated, the nerves around the user’s eyes become prominent, giving even a beautiful face an intimidating appearance.

**Prerequisites**: Perception 1, Genin
**Benefit**: Activating Byakugan requires a **partial action** and **1 chakra point**. The doujutsu lasts for an entire scene and can be activated during defense. While active, the user gains the following benefits:

- **Super Vision**: Grants **360° X-ray vision**, seeing through any material and ignoring all levels of **Cover**. The user is unaffected by **Partial or Total Camouflage** penalties from environmental sources (illusions or blindness penalties still apply).
- **Chakra Vision**: Allows the user to see chakra by color, identifying when an opponent uses a jutsu, even if hidden, and detecting if someone is trapped in a genjutsu or if a jutsu affects an area or creature.
- **Vision Through Chakra**: The user can see through chakra-based effects, unaffected by techniques like **Mist** (Suiton).
- **Measure Power**: The user can estimate a creature’s approximate strength (character sheet level) by observing their chakra.
- **Distinguish Chakra**: The user can differentiate creatures by their unique chakra signatures.
- **Analyze Emotions**: By observing chakra fluctuations, heartbeats, and breathing, the user can detect emotions (e.g., lying, happiness, hostility).
- **No Surprise or Flanking**: The user cannot be **surprised** or **flanked** while Byakugan is active.
- **Free Action**: Once per scene, as a **free action**, the user can simulate **2 dice (2d8 = 16)** for **Perception**, **Search**, **Notice**, or **Track** tests that rely on vision, even under pressure.
- **Range**: Standard vision range is **10m + 2m per Track skill level**.
- **Extended Range** (requires Track 5): By concentrating and performing hand seals, the user doubles the standard range starting the next turn, as long as concentration is maintained.

### TENKETSU BYAKUGAN

The Byakugan can see **tenketsu** (chakra points), and with the Hyuuga’s precise chakra control, the user can send chakra to these points to temporarily seal them.

**Prerequisites**: Byakugan, Search 7, Notice 7, Track 7  
**Benefit**: When using Byakugan, you gain the following additional benefits:

- **Tenketsu Sealing**: When hitting an opponent with a basic **Juuken** attack, the target must make a **Vigor test** (DC 7 + 2x Juuken level). Failure seals one tenketsu, costing the target **2 chakra points**. For **Multiattack**, a test is required per successful hit. Sealed chakra recovers after a night’s rest.
    - If the target defends with an **unarmed block**, they must still make the Vigor test, even if the block succeeds, unless they also have **Tenketsu Byakugan**.
    - Special Juuken techniques (e.g., **Hakke Rokujuuyon Shou**) can seal more chakra points without allowing a Vigor test.
- **Progressive Range** (requires Track 9): By remaining immobile and concentrating for **2 minutes (20 rounds)**, the user can extend their Byakugan’s range to **50m per Track level**. This lasts only while immobile and concentrating, costing **half Track level in chakra**.

## RESTRICTED POWERS

### JUUKEN (GENTLE FIST)

Members of the **Hyuuga Clan** can purchase the restricted **Juuken** power, gaining access to the following techniques based on the power’s level.

**Prerequisites**: Spirit 1, Byakugan, Finesse (Feat)


#### LEVEL 1: JUUKEN (GENTLE FIST)

- **Type**: Taijutsu / Fighting Stance, Kekkei Genkai, Chakra Control
- **Action**: Free
- **Range**: Personal
- **Duration**: Continuous
- **Chakra Cost**: 0

The signature fighting stance of the Hyuuga Clan, requiring an active **Byakugan** to see the opponent’s chakra network and internal organs.

Each **Juuken** attack is an **unarmed lethal attack**, channeling chakra through the hands to damage internal organs. Attacks use only the hands and calculate damage using **Dexterity**:  

> **Base Damage**: (Dexterity ÷ 2) + (Weapon Damage: 1)

**Weapon Damage** increases with power level:

- **Juuken 4**: 2 weapon damage
- **Juuken 5**: 3 weapon damage
- **Juuken 6**: 4 weapon damage (maximum)

Normal damage bonuses and penalties apply. Juuken ignores **half of passive body hardness**, up to **2 points**.

**Maneuver feats** can be used with Level 1 Juuken attacks but not with other Juuken techniques unless specified.


#### LEVEL 2: JŪKENPŌ ICHIGEKISHIN (GENTLE FIST STYLE: BODY BLAST)

- **Type**: Taijutsu, Kekkei Genkai, Chakra Control
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: 3m
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Chakra Cost**: 2

The Hyuuga expels chakra from all tenketsu, creating a **non-damaging chakra explosion** that repels enemies in close combat, breaks grapples, or destroys bindings.

Affects all targets within **3m**, requiring a **Ranged Combat (RC)** test against their defenses. The explosion is **invisible** to those without chakra-sensing abilities, making them **flat-footed**. Affected targets must pass an **Acrobatics Check (DC 13)** or fall **prone**.

- **Grappling Targets**: No defense is allowed unless they release the grapple as a reaction (Automatic Success).
- **Large+ Creatures**: Unaffected.
- **Bindings/Prisons**: Deals **2 base damage per power level** to bindings on the user’s body.
- **Immaterial Elements**: Repels immaterial effects on the user’s body if their power level or chakra cost is lower than Juuken’s level. Cannot affect techniques like **Kage Mane** (targets the shadow, not the body).


#### LEVEL 3: HAKKESHOU KAITEN (DIVINE OCTAGRAM ROTATION)

- **Type**: Taijutsu, Kekkei Genkai, Chakra Control
- **Action**: Standard (or Partial, see text)

The user spins, releasing precise chakra from all pores to create a **rotating chakra hemisphere**. Requires free movement; cannot be used if **immobilized** or under movement restrictions.

**Offensive Use**: Costs **2 chakra**. Affects all within **2m** (or **5m** at level 6), dealing **normal Juuken damage**. Targets must pass an **Acrobatics or Vigor Check (CD 7 + 2x Power Level)** or fall **prone**.

**Defensive Use**: Costs **1 chakra per power level**. Used as a **Defend with Technique** maneuver, substituting **Melee Combat (MC)** for **Anticipate Movement (AM)** in the defense test. Acts as a **chakra barrier** with **hardness 3 + 2x Power Level**, which cannot be ignored. If the attack’s base damage exceeds the hardness, Kaiten is disrupted, and excess damage applies to the user.

- **Collateral Damage**: Allies or enemies within range take damage based on the defense test result. If the attacker is within range, they cannot defend. Others defend normally.
- **Partial Action**: If no one is harmed, only a **partial action** is needed.
