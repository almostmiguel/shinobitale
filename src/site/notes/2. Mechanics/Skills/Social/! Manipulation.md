Measures a character’s ability to get someone to do what they want through bluffing, smooth-talking, or deception. Whether the target wants to be manipulated or not is irrelevant (this is the main difference between Manipulation and Charisma), and even someone who hates the character can be manipulated by them.

However, Manipulation is a dangerous art. Failing to manipulate someone often earns their resentment. In the case of a critical failure, you can be certain your name will end up on the target’s list of enemies.
