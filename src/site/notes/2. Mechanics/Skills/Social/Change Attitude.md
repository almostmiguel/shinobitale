*Manipulation + ½ Perception*

You can shift someone’s attitude by one category (see below), for better or worse, at your choice. A Change Attitude check is opposed by the target’s Intelligence check. The attempt takes one minute; in urgent situations, you can attempt it as a Full Action (e.g., to prevent a fight), but you take a -8 penalty to the check. You can only attempt to change someone’s attitude once per day. If you fail by 4 or more, the target’s attitude shifts in the opposite direction.

You can also make a Change Attitude check using Charisma, but only to improve the target’s attitude.

|**Attitude**|**The Target...**|
|---|---|
|**Hostile**|Wants to greatly harm the character, even if it means taking risks. May attack or sabotage the character.|
|**Unfriendly**|Wishes ill on the character but not to the point of endangering themselves. May deceive the character or spread rumors about them.|
|**Indifferent**|Doesn’t care about the character and will treat them neutrally.|
|**Friendly**|Wishes well for the character but won’t take risks to help them. May offer advice or limited assistance.|
|**Helpful**|Is willing to help, even at personal risk. May accompany and fight alongside the character.|
