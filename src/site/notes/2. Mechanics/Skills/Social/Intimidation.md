*Manipulation + ½ Perception*

You can force others to obey you through threats, coercion, or simply a menacing expression.

A successful Intimidation check compels someone to do something or behave in a certain way. The check is opposed by the target’s Intelligence check. Any modifiers the target has against fear effects also apply to their Intelligence check. Characters immune to fear cannot be intimidated.

On a success, the target complies while in your presence and for an additional 1d8 × 10 minutes afterward. After this time, they become Unfriendly or even Hostile. If you fail by 4 or more, the target does not obey—or may do the opposite of what you ordered.
