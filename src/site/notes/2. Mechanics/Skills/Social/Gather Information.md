*Charisma + ½ Intelligence*

You can make contacts, listen to local rumors, and uncover specific information—such as the location of a dungeon or a bandit’s hideout.

Using this Skill requires a full day and some money spent on drinks. The difficulty of the check and the amount of money spent depend on the information you seek:

- **General Information** (e.g., “Who is the strongest Jounin in the village?”): DC 8, costs 300 Ryos.
- **Specific Information** (e.g., “Who is the ninja always by the Hokage’s side?”): DC 12, costs 500 Ryos.
- **Restricted Information**, known to few people (e.g., “What do they do in that mysterious tower?”): DC 16, costs 900 Ryos.
- **Protected Information**, which could endanger the responder (e.g., “Who is the leader of the nukenin group?”): DC 20, costs 1500 Ryos.

You can pay double the money for a +2 bonus to the check.
