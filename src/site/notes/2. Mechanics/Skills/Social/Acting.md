*Charisma + Â½ Art*

You can captivate an audience with your music, singing, poetry, or other artistic expressions. You can only perform in styles of art you know. Examples include:

- **Dramaturgy** (comedy, drama, mime).
- **Dance** (ballet, belly dance, waltz).
- **Music** (mandolin, singing, flute, harp, drum, piano).
- **Oratory** (speeches, poetry).

Your performance as an artist depends on the result of your check:

- **DC 12**: A routine performance (the minimum needed to avoid getting tomatoes thrown at you...).
- **DC 20**: A great performance.
- **DC 28**: An unforgettable spectacle, capable of pleasing kings
