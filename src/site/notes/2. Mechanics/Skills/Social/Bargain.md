*Charisma + Â½ Perception*

When buying or selling something, you can attempt to haggle. You and the other merchant make opposed Bargain checks. If you win, you adjust the price by 10% in your favor. If you win by 8 or more points, you adjust the price by 20%. However, if you lose by 4 or more, you offend the merchant, and they refuse to deal with you for at least one week.
