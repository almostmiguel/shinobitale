*Manipulation + ½ Intelligence*

You can lead others to draw incorrect conclusions about something or someone. A Bluff check is opposed by the target’s Intelligence check. Circumstances, both positive and negative, significantly affect the outcome of a bluff. A successful check means the target reacts as the character desires, at least briefly (until their next turn), or believes something the character wants them to believe. Bluffing requires a Standard Action.

You can also bluff using Charisma instead of Manipulation. However, you take a +3 difficulty penalty if the target is Unfriendly, and a +6 penalty if they are Hostile. Conversely, you gain a -3 difficulty bonus if the target is Friendly, and a -6 bonus if they are Helpful.

**Examples of Bluff Circumstances and Modifiers**:

- The target wants to believe the character (DC -4). _“I’m sure you dropped this gold ring. Isn’t it yours?”_
- The bluff is believable and doesn’t greatly affect the target (DC +0). _“A thief, you say? No, I haven’t seen anyone like that pass by here.”_
- The bluff is somewhat hard to believe or puts the target in danger (DC +4). _“Quick, I need your sword! There’s a thug coming this way!”_
- The bluff is hard to believe or puts the target in significant danger (DC +8). _“Yes, I understand your master left you guarding the lab, but he just asked me to fetch that journal inside. We don’t want trouble with the master, do we?”_
- The bluff is highly implausible, almost impossible to believe (DC +16). _“Yes, that’s what I said! The Kage has been replaced by an impostor and is now planning to ally with the Akatsuki! We have to do something!”_
