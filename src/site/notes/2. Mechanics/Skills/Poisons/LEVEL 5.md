**Prerequisite**: Dokujutsu 8, Poisoncraft 18  
Lethal poisons that are difficult to handle. Their high resistance difficulty and devastating effects make them highly sought after, though their manipulation is complex and dangerous. Only specialists in assassination typically work with Level V poisons. The cost for materials to attempt one dose is 200 Ryos.

# **Red Death**  
The Red Death is one of the worst torments a person can endure. It is an alchemical blend of the most venomous animals’ poisons, creating a dark red, almost black, viscous liquid. It is suitable for coating projectile tips or cutting/piercing weapons, requiring a damage degree of 3 or higher to inject.

Once in the victim’s body, whether by ingestion or injection, the poison spreads rapidly, causing an unimaginable rejection response. Veins through which it passes bulge visibly, appearing like red roots on the skin, in an agonizing process. In severe cases, the body tries to expel blood in any way possible, causing inexplicable ruptures of veins and arteries in a process that can last minutes, depending on the victim’s resistance. Survivors of Red Death often become insane or bloodthirsty.

**Effects**:

- **If the victim fails the resistance check**: They feel their blood boiling, as described above, and become debilitated (-3) for all checks for 1 hour.
- Each time they fail a subsequent resistance check, they lose 15 Vitality points.
- If they fail three resistance checks (consecutive or not), they become paralyzed and fall to the ground. On the next round, they fall unconscious, and their Vitality is reduced to zero. If not treated within three days, the character dies.
- Crafting an antidote for Red Death is so difficult that it is said to be incurable.

# **Red Scorpion Venom**  
This is the most practical version of the most dangerous natural venom: that of a red scorpion. These creatures are strikingly beautiful, with bodies that shine like pure gold, but their sting is extremely dangerous. Rare and coveted, red scorpions are found only in the largest deserts, hidden under the tallest sand dunes, adding to their mystique.

The venom evaporates quickly upon contact with air, making it hard to handle, but if processed to remain on weapons during combat, it can fetch exorbitant prices from the right buyers. It only works if injected directly into the victim’s bloodstream, requiring a cutting or piercing weapon coated with the substance to deal a damage degree of 3 or higher. Producing this poison requires a live red scorpion.

**Effects**:

- **If the victim fails the resistance check**: They become paralyzed due to pain in the first round of the poison’s effect, lose 10 Vitality points per round, and become debilitated (-3) for all checks for 1 day.
- If they fail three resistance checks (consecutive or not), they become paralyzed and fall to the ground. On the next round, they fall unconscious, and their Vitality is reduced to zero. If not treated within three days, the character dies.
- It is said that this poison cannot be neutralized by any known medical procedure.

# **Black Salamander Venom**  
The black salamander is a rare creature native to Amegakure, famous for the deadly venom its body produces, comparable only to the red scorpion’s venom.

It is said that a black salamander’s venom sac was once implanted into a child, granting them the ability to produce the same venom and develop resistance to it. Even breathing near this child was dangerous, as their breath released toxins.

**Effects**: The rules for Black Salamander Venom are identical to those for Red Scorpion Venom.
