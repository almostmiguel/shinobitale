Poisons with considerable resistance difficulty and dangerous effects. Most snake and scorpion venoms fall into this category. The cost for materials to produce one dose is 50 Ryos.

# **Effective Sedative**  
This transparent liquid causes significant drowsiness when ingested. It is typically mixed with wine or strong beverages to mask its smell.

**Effects**:

- **If the victim fails the resistance check**: They become drowsy and struggle to perceive their surroundings, becoming debilitated for Anticipate Movement, Perception, and related Skill checks. Additionally, they fall unconscious at the end of the 6th round of the poisonâ€™s effect, for up to 2 hours. The victim can be awakened by sudden movements or loud noises. Waking the victim during combat is a Standard Action.

# **Effective Paralyzing Poison**  
Similar to the Minor Paralyzing Poison but with greater refinement of the natural venom extracted from scorpions to enhance its potency.

**Effects**:

- **If the victim fails the resistance check**: They experience intense pain, discomfort, and fatigue, becoming dazed for 4 hours.
