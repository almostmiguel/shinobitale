**Prerequisite**: Poisoncraft 16  
Complex poisons with high resistance difficulty and varied forms. Their effects can be lethal. The most dangerous snakes produce venom at this level. The cost for materials to produce one dose is 100 Ryos.

# **Potent Sedative**  
This colorless liquid has a strong smell and evaporates upon contact with air, capable of knocking someone out in seconds. It is typically used to soak cloths placed over the victim’s face and only works if its concentrated vapor is inhaled.

**Effects**:

- **If the victim fails the resistance check**: They become drowsy and struggle to perceive their surroundings, becoming debilitated (-2) for Anticipate Movement, Perception, and related Skill checks. They fall unconscious at the end of the 4th round of the poison’s effect, for up to 2 hours. The sleep is heavy, and the victim does not easily wake from sudden movements or loud noises. Waking the victim during combat is a Full Action.

# **Potent Paralyzing Poison**  
Extracted from highly dangerous snakes (e.g., Black Mamba), this poison is processed to be viscous enough to stay on weapons during combat. It only works if injected directly into the victim’s bloodstream, requiring a cutting or piercing weapon coated with the substance to deal a damage degree of 3 or higher. Producing this poison requires one dose of natural venom from a Black Mamba.

**Effects**:

- **If the victim fails the resistance check**: They experience intense pain and begin losing muscle control, becoming dazed for 4 hours. Additionally, if they fail the resistance check by 4 or more, they become stunned for 1 round.
