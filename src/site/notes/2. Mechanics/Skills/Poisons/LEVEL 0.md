**Prerequisite**: Poisoncraft 4  
Simple poisons with low resistance difficulty and milder effects. They use inexpensive, easily obtainable materials. The cost for materials to produce one dose is 10 Ryos.

# **Debilitating Poison**  
This substance is greatly feared by those who know it, not for its lethality but for the “social damage” it causes to victims. This poison is produced as an oil that, when ingested, can cause intense stomach pains followed by diarrhea.

It is always applied to food, preferably greasy and spicy, to mask its taste. If applied to a liquid, the poison forms a visible “film” on the surface, making it immediately noticeable.

**Effects**:

- **If the victim passes the resistance check**: They feel unwell after a few minutes, needing to use the bathroom as soon as possible, but suffer no penalties.
- **If the victim fails the resistance check**: They experience severe stomach pains followed by an almost uncontrollable release of gas. Within minutes, they suffer intense diarrhea that cannot be held back for more than two minutes, regardless of their location. The diarrhea lasts for two days unless treated (via a Medicine check). In this state, the victim takes a -1 penalty to accuracy on social checks.

# **Irritating Poison**  
This poison is a paste made by crushing specific leaves. Upon contact with the body, it causes severe skin irritation, potentially leading to redness and swelling across the entire body. It is typically applied to the inner lining of a victim’s clothing, triggering a resistance check when they wear it.

**Effects**:

- **If the victim fails the resistance check**: Their skin becomes very red with swelling across the body, including the face. They take a -1 penalty to accuracy on all social checks. The effects last for 5 hours.

**Artificial Poison**  
Also called the “cheap poison,” this fully artificial poison requires no natural or rare substances, making it relatively inexpensive. Its effectiveness is limited, but its low cost per dose often compensates. It only works if injected directly into the victim’s bloodstream, requiring a cutting or piercing weapon coated with the substance to deal a damage degree of 3 or higher.

**Effects**:

- **If the victim fails the resistance check**: They experience intense pain and become debilitated for any checks they make (except resistance checks) for 4 hours.
