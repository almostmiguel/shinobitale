*Dexterity / Armor*

You can walk a tightrope, fall without getting hurt, and perform other acrobatic feats.

**Cushion Fall**: You can reduce damage from a fall.

**Tumble**: You can move through a space occupied by an enemy as part of your movement. Make an Acrobatics check opposed by the opponent’s Dexterity check. If you succeed, you pass through the space; if you fail, you cannot pass through, and your Move Action ends.

You can also use this maneuver to escape close-quarters combat without provoking opportunity attacks. If there are multiple enemies, you must make a check against each one. Using Tumble halves the character’s total movement.

**Balance**: You can balance while moving on precarious surfaces, such as a slippery floor (DC 8), the top of a narrow wall (DC 12), or a taut rope (DC 16). Each Move Action in such situations requires an Acrobatics check. On a success, you can move half your movement speed; on a failure, you cannot move; and if you fail by 4 or more, you fall.

**Stand Up Quickly (DC 18)**: If you are prone, you can stand up as a partial action. If you fail by 3 or more, you lose a Move Action and remain prone. You cannot use this maneuver if an adjacent enemy has a Melee Combat (MC) level higher than your Dodge.

**Squeeze Through Tight Space (DC 24)**: You can crawl through tight spaces large enough for creatures one size category smaller (e.g., a human could pass through a space suitable for a dog) as a full action. In this condition, you move at half your movement speed.
