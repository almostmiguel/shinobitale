*Dexterity*

You can pickpocket or plant objects in others’ pockets without them noticing.

**Object Trick**: Make a Sleight of Hand check (DC 16). On a success, you successfully hide, take, or plant the desired object. The target is entitled to a Notice check (DC equal to the result of your Sleight of Hand check). If they succeed, they notice your attempt, whether you succeeded or not. Attempting to pickpocket or plant something requires a Standard Action.

**Disguise Technique**: You can use Sleight of Hand as a free action to conceal the gestures of a technique, making it harder to identify. Make an opposed check against the target’s Notice check. If you succeed, the opponent takes a -2 penalty to their Culture or Occultism check to identify the technique used.
