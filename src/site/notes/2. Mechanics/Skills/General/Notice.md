*Perception*

Notice is used to passively perceive things through the senses—typically sight or hearing, though other creatures may rely on different senses. It measures your attention to your surroundings when you’re not actively searching.

**Observe**: You can notice things, people, or creatures that are hidden. The check is opposed by the Stealth check of the character trying to remain unseen (see more in the Stealth Skill, page 41).

Sometimes the target isn’t intentionally hiding but still requires a check to be noticed. In these cases, it’s a check against a Difficulty Class, ranging from DC 4 (a person in a lightly crowded square) to DC 20 (a specific soldier in the midst of a large battle).

**Listen**: You can attempt to hear things like a distant conversation or an enemy approaching silently. In dungeons, it’s prudent to stop and listen before entering a new corridor or room.

The difficulty depends on the noise’s intensity:

- A nearby casual conversation has DC 0—meaning, unless there’s a penalty (see below), you succeed automatically.
- Hearing whispers has DC 12.
- Listening through a door increases the DC by +4.

To hear someone approaching stealthily, make a Notice check opposed by the creature’s Stealth check. Detecting invisible or hidden creatures by sound reveals their approximate location but does not remove combat penalties (see more about Camouflage, page 272).

Even while sleeping, you can make Notice checks to hear something, but you take a -8 penalty; a success wakes you up.

A Notice check can reveal tracks, but to identify and follow them, you must use the Track Skill.
