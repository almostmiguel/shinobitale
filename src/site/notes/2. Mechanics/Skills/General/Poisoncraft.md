*Intelligence / Trained*

This Skill can only be purchased if you have the Chemist feat. The character has knowledge of poisons, including their preparation and use. They can attempt to identify a poison or its symptoms, prepare various poisons, and handle them correctly (it is not possible to manipulate poisons without this Skill).

At the end of this section, there is a basic description of each type of poison mentioned in the Poisoncraft Skill, along with examples of substances that fit each type. At the Game Master’s discretion, other poisons not listed may exist.

**Poison Levels**: Poisons range from Level 0 (zero) to Level V (five). The higher the poison’s level, the greater the resistance difficulty and the more dangerous its effects. Level V poisons are even more restricted and require the restricted power Dokujutsu.

The level of poison/antidote that can be crafted is determined by the Poisoncraft Skill, as shown in the table below.

**Fabrication Checks**: If the character has the necessary time, resources, and an equipped laboratory, no check is required to produce a poison or antidote. However, producing a poison or antidote outside these conditions, using a basic portable kit, requires a Poisoncraft check (DC equal to the resistance DC).

If the campaign rules, as set by the Game Master, state that the village fully sponsors the ninja, meaning they don’t need to worry about costs, the Game Master may require Poisoncraft checks to determine how many doses of poison the character can take on a mission, at their discretion.

The Game Master may also require a check to produce poisons or antidotes under adverse conditions (e.g., identifying a poison used on an ally and producing an antidote before they die, racing against time).

| **Poison Level** | **Prerequisite** | **Resistance Check (Vigor)** |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Level 0          | Poisoncraft 4    | DC 11 + ½ Poisoncraft Level  |
| Level I          | Poisoncraft 10   | DC 12 + ½ Poisoncraft Level  |
| Level II         | Poisoncraft 12   | DC 13 + ½ Poisoncraft Level  |
| Level III        | Poisoncraft 14   | DC 14 + ½ Poisoncraft Level  |
| Level IV         | Poisoncraft 16   | DC 15 + ½ Poisoncraft Level  |
| Level V          | Poisoncraft 18   | DC 16 + ½ Poisoncraft Level  |

**Cost**: The basic description of poison types includes the cost in money for common materials to produce one dose of poison or antidote using the Poisoncraft Skill. These materials can be obtained relatively easily in any medium-to-large village.

**Rare Materials**: Some poisons require special ingredients that are typically hard to find. Any special ingredients needed for a poison will be noted in its description.

**Quantity**: A single container can hold 15 liquid doses of any poison type or 6 poisonous smoke bombs. Poisonous smoke bombs follow the same rules as standard smoke bombs. Additionally, an enemy who breathes in their area suffers the poison’s effects as if it were injected directly into their bloodstream. Thus, only poisons used via injection can be used in poisonous smoke bombs.

When a smoke bomb is used, the victim can make a Natural Sciences check as a reaction (DC equal to the resistance DC) to identify or suspect it’s a poisonous smoke. If the victim has trained Poisoncraft, they immediately recognize it as a poison (though not necessarily which one) without needing a check. If they realize it’s a poisonous smoke, the victim can immediately hold their breath as a free action. To continue holding their breath from their turn onward, the victim must make Vigor checks.

**Poisoned Weapons**: For poisons that must be injected directly into the victim’s bloodstream, you can use a cutting or piercing weapon coated with the substance (or use poisonous smoke bombs, as mentioned).

Properly preparing a weapon consumes one dose of poison per weapon or for every 10 projectiles, takes 1 minute, and requires full concentration. It’s not time-consuming, but be cautious when doing this during combat! If you prefer to keep weapons pre-coated with poison, the application lasts on the weapon for up to one month. Using the Energize effect on a poisoned weapon destroys the poison unless it’s applied via the hijutsu Dokujutsu.

To inject a poison applied to a weapon into an opponent, you must attack and deal a damage degree of 3 or higher.

**Mixing Poisons**: It’s not possible to mix different poisons on weapons, doses, or smoke bombs. Similarly, you cannot use two smoke bombs with different poisons simultaneously. Doing so causes the different chemicals to react unpredictably, resulting in no effect.

However, a single victim can suffer the effects of two or more poisons simultaneously, whether different or the same, as long as they were applied in separate actions without mixing. If the same poison affects a victim multiple times, each instance is resolved independently.

**Poison Rules**: The poison list includes descriptions and the effects the victim suffers if they pass or fail the resistance check.

**Effect Duration**: When a victim’s body comes into contact with a poison (via ingestion, inhalation, cutting, or other means), it takes time to take effect. Unless the description states otherwise, a poison takes at least 2 rounds to begin circulating in the victim’s body, and resistance checks begin only at the start of the 3rd round. If you have the Dokujutsu power, the effect duration is reduced by 1 round.

**Body Resistance**: After the effect duration, the victim must begin making resistance checks. Resisting a poison requires a Vigor check at the start of each of the victim’s turns. If they fail, they suffer the effects described in the poison’s description. The DC is determined by the table above and depends on both the poison’s level and the Poisoncraft Skill level of the character.

Whether successful or not, this check must be repeated each turn while the victim remains in contact with the poison or until treated. If the victim achieves 3 successes (consecutive or not), the poison’s effects end and only return after the scene ends. This 3-success rule does not apply to Level V poisons.

Accuracy penalties caused by poisons do not affect resistance checks.

**Antidotes**: An antidote takes the same amount of time as a poison to take effect and only works against the specific poison it was made for. When the antidote takes effect, all poison penalties are removed, but the character becomes fatigued until they sleep.
