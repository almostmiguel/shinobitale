*Intelligence / Trained*

You can treat injuries, diseases, and poisons. With the exception of first aid, all other uses of this Skill require the Medical Ninja feat.

**First Aid (DC 16)**: With a Standard Action, you can stabilize a bleeding character, stopping their Vitality loss. Each successful Medicine check (DC 16) removes 1 level of bleeding.

**Long-Term Care (DC 12)**: You can treat an injured person to help them recover faster. If you succeed on the check, they recover twice as many Vitality points from natural healing that day. This use takes one hour, and the maximum number of people you can treat per day equals half your Medicine Skill level.

**Treat Disease**: Make a check against the disease’s DC. On a success, the patient gains a +4 bonus to their next Vigor check against the disease. This use takes one hour.

**Treat Poison**: Make a check against the poison’s DC. On a success, the patient gains a +4 bonus to their next Vigor check against the poison. This use takes a Standard Action.

**Surgery**: You can perform surgeries. The Game Master determines the DC based on the procedure’s risk level. If you fail the check, the surgery fails. If you fail by 4 or more, the patient dies.

Using this Skill requires a medical kit (or a surgical equipment room). Without it, you suffer a -4 penalty to Medicine checks. You can use the Medicine Skill on yourself, but you take a -4 penalty to the check.

Using this Skill during combat leaves the character flat-footed unless they have the Medical Ninja feat.
