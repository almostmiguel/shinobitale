*Intelligence / Trained*

This Skill allows you to disable, reactivate, or sabotage (but not repair) various mechanical devices, such as locks, traps, and vehicles. You can also sabotage devices to function temporarily, failing only later (typically after 2 rounds or several minutes of use).

This Skill requires a toolkit. Without it, you suffer a -4 penalty to the check.

**Operate Mechanisms**: Using this Skill takes 2 rounds, and the difficulty depends on the task’s complexity:

- Simple action (e.g., jamming a lock or projectile-firing weapon): DC 8.
- Slightly less simple action (e.g., sabotaging a wagon wheel, drawbridge, or balloon): DC 12.
- Moderate action (e.g., disabling or reactivating a trap): DC 16.
- Highly complex action (e.g., disabling or reactivating an advanced trap, or sabotaging a device to explode when used): DC 20.

If you fail by 4 or more, something goes terribly wrong: if it’s a trap, it activates; if you’re attempting sabotage, you believe the device is disabled, but it actually continues to function normally.

**Open Locks**: With a full action, you can open a locked lock (i.e., without the key). A simple lock (e.g., a house’s front door) has DC 16. A medium lock (e.g., prison, chest) has DC 20. A superior lock (e.g., safe, treasure vault) has DC 24.

**Create Trap**: To create a trap, you need materials, time, and the Game Master’s final approval, following the parameters below. This use of the Skill requires the Engineer feat.

**Time**: Preparing a trap takes 10 minutes and 1 use of the toolkit, and it cannot be built without the kit. No check is required to construct the trap, but it cannot be done under pressure.

**Type**: You can build a trap that either explodes with explosive tags or fires simple throwing weapons at the victim. The number of tags or projectiles used depends on the desired damage and, for tags, the explosion’s area.

- **Projectiles**: The base damage of this trap type equals 1 per projectile used. For example, a trap firing 3 kunais deals 3 base damage. This type of trap targets a single point chosen by you during construction.
- **Explosive Tags**: The base damage and explosion area follow the standard rules for explosive tags.

**Damage Limit**: The base damage of a trap cannot exceed your Mechanisms Skill level, and the damage degree cannot exceed 3.

**Trigger**: Made with strings from the toolkit. When the victim passes through the chosen trap location, the string breaks, activating the trap.

**Activation**: If the victim doesn’t notice the trap through a Search or Notice check (see Skills), they inevitably trigger it.

Those hit by the trap can make a reaction to attempt an Dexterity check to escape or a Notice check to spot the activation at the last moment and flee. The DC is 7 + the builder’s Mechanisms level. If the trap hits its targets, you roll two dice to determine the damage degree (this degree applies to all targets).
