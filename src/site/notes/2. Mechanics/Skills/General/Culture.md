*Intelligence*

Culture represents a character’s general knowledge of the world (history, religion, nobility) and their knowledge of ninja-related matters (the number and types of jutsus known, villages and their leaders, famous ninjas and clans).


**Measuring Knowledge**: Sometimes, a Culture check isn’t needed. Instead, the Skill level determines whether a character knows about a specific topic.
