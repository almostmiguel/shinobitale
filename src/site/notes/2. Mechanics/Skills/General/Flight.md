*Dexterity / Armor*

Flight is a special Skill that only certain creatures possess, and thus it is not included on the standard character sheet. The method of flight is described in the rules for the creature or technique that grants the use of this Skill, with wings being the most common form.

This Skill has a level equal to the Dexterity Attribute (unless a special rule states otherwise) and allows the creature to fly at a height of 1m for each level of the Skill.

Taking off or moving in the air counts as movement (i.e., if you take off by moving only vertically, you cannot move in any other way for that round). When moving, the combined vertical and horizontal distances must be within your total movement speed.

Creatures in flight can make Athletics checks, or use the Flight Skill itself, to increase the distance traveled, as if performing a running maneuver. Flying outside of combat also grants a +10m bonus to movement speed.
