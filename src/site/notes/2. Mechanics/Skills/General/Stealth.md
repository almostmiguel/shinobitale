*Dexterity / Armor*

You can vanish into the shadows, move silently, blend into a crowd, or follow someone without being noticed.

**Camouflage and Cover**: Using Stealth requires some form of cover or camouflage between you and your targets—darkness, foliage, a crowd you can blend into, etc. Alternatively, your targets must have their backs turned or be distracted by something else. Without this, you cannot attempt a check, and any attempt is an automatic failure.

Even with cover, you cannot hide if an opponent is actively looking at you. However, you can hide with camouflage, provided it’s large enough to cover most of your movement.

Carrying noisy objects imposes a -3 penalty to the accuracy of your Stealth check.

**Actions**: Using Stealth is a Standard Action. You still need to spend actions to move to your cover or camouflage if necessary.

**Movement**: You must remain still or move slowly, at half your movement speed (or at the same speed as the people around you, if in a crowd). Moving at normal speed imposes a -4 penalty to your check, and running or charging imposes a -16 penalty.

**Check**: Your Stealth check is opposed by Notice, Search, or Track. The skill used by the opponent depends on the situation.

**Stealth vs. Notice**: The moment you use Stealth, all opponents who could potentially detect you can make a Notice check as a reaction. You make a single Stealth check against all opponents, who roll their Notice checks individually. If you succeed, you go unnoticed by any enemies who fail their opposed check.

**Stealth vs. Search**: On their turns, enemies who failed their Notice check can use a Standard Action to try to find you (if they suspect someone is nearby). The enemy must still spend actions to move through the area or use another method to search. In this case, you must make a new Stealth check, opposed by the opponent’s Search check.

**Stealth vs. Track**: Your Stealth check is opposed by an enemy’s Track check when you’ve hidden in a past scene. In other words, the enemy tries to find you or the path you took by following traces you left behind. Otherwise, it follows the same rules as a Search check.

**Sneak Attack**: If you attack someone who failed their check against your Stealth, that target is considered flat-footed (taking a -3 penalty to defenses and losing Dodge bonuses).
