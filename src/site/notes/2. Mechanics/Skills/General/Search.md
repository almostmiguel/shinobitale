*Perception*

Search is used to actively perceive things through the senses—typically sight or hearing, though other creatures may rely on different senses. It measures how well you can use your senses to find something you are deliberately seeking.

**Observe**: You can notice things, people, or creatures that are hidden. The check is opposed by the Stealth check of the character trying to remain unseen.

Sometimes the target isn’t intentionally hiding but still requires a check to be noticed. In these cases, it’s a check against a Difficulty Class, ranging from DC 4 (a person in a lightly crowded square) to DC 20 (a specific soldier in the midst of a large battle).

**Listen**: You can attempt to hear things like a distant conversation or an enemy approaching silently. In dungeons, it’s prudent to stop and listen before entering a new corridor or room.

The difficulty depends on the noise’s intensity:

- A nearby casual conversation has DC 0—meaning, unless there’s a penalty (see below), you succeed automatically.
- Hearing whispers has DC 12.
- Listening through a door increases the DC by +4.

To hear someone approaching stealthily, make a Search check opposed by the creature’s Stealth check. Detecting invisible or hidden creatures by sound reveals their approximate location but does not remove combat penalties.

**Search an Area**: By carefully examining an object or location, you can notice useful details or find something you’re looking for. You must be within 3m of the item or area being examined. Examining a 1m-diameter area requires a full action.

- Searching for a specific item in a chest full of objects: DC 8.
- Finding a secret door: DC 16.
- Noticing a very well-hidden secret door: DC 24.
- Finding traps: DC 7 + the builder’s Mechanisms Skill level.

A Search check can reveal tracks, but to identify and follow them, you must use the Track Skill.
