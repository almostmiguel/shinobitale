*Perception / Trained*

You can guide horses pulling a cart, train a guard dog, and perform other animal-related tasks.

**Tame a Wild Animal (DC 20)**: You can raise a wild animal from a young age, domesticating it. The time required varies depending on the creature.

**Teach a Trick (DC 12)**: You can teach a trick (e.g., attack, perform, stay, guard, fetch, search, protect, quiet, growl, follow, come) with a check and one week of training. An animal with Intelligence 1 can learn up to three tricks, while an animal with Intelligence 2 can learn up to six tricks (creatures with Intelligence 3 or higher are considered sentient).

**Push an Animal (DC 20)**: You can force an animal to perform a trick it doesnâ€™t know but is physically capable of doing. This use requires a full action, and on a success, the animal performs the trick on its next action.

**Handle an Animal (DC 8)**: You can command an animal to perform a trick it already knows. This use requires a Standard Action, and on a success, the animal performs the trick on its next action. You can use this even without training in Animal Handling.

All characters receive a +4 bonus to Animal Handling checks involving their own animal companion.
