*Strength / Armor*

This Skill is used to perform athletic feats such as running fast, climbing mountains, swimming in rough waters, and jumping over chasms.

**Running**: You can run faster by spending a full action. Make an Athletics check. Your movement speed increases by 1m times the result of your check. For example, if a character achieves a result of 24, their movement speed increases by 24m for that round.

You can maintain running for a number of rounds equal to your Vigor level. After that, you must make a Vigor check (DC 9 + 1 per previous check) each round to continue running. If you fail, you must stop and rest for one minute before running again.

**Climbing**: You can climb trees, walls, steep slopes, and other inclined surfaces. Make a check each time you take a Move Action on an inclined or vertical surface. On a success, you advance half your movement speed or stay in place (if doing something else). If you fail, you cannot perform the Move Action. If you fail by 4 or more, you fall from the height youâ€™ve reached.

The difficulty depends on the climbing conditions: DC 4 for a steep slope, DC 8 for a wall with a rope, DC 12 for a tree, DC 16 for a wall with some handholds, or DC 20 for a very smooth wall with almost no supports.

You need both hands free to climb. You can brace with one hand to perform a single-handed action but cannot advance while doing so. Since you cannot move to avoid attacks, you are considered flat-footed while climbing. Whenever you take damage while climbing, you must make a new Athletics check; if you fail, you fall.

**Swimming**: You can swim, dive, and avoid underwater obstacles. Each round in the water requires a Move Action and an Athletics check (DC 8 for calm water, 12 for rough water, 16 for stormy water). On a success, you advance half your movement speed. If you fail, you can float but cannot advance; if you fail by 4 or more, you sink.

If you are submerged (due to failing a check or diving intentionally), you must hold your breath or suffer suffocation.

**Jumping**: You can jump over gaps or obstacles or reach elevated objects. You can perform a jump of 5m plus 1m for every 2 levels of Athletics. This value applies to both long jumps and high jumps.

Jumping is part of your movement and does not require an action. The height or distance of the jump is counted within your movement speed.
