*Intelligence*

You are an artist, capable of creating sculptures, paintings, drawings, or writing books, short stories, or poetry. Choose an artistic style when you purchase the first level of this Skill, and an additional style for every 4 levels gained.

**Appraisal**: A check can estimate the value of an item related to your art—from something you can create to an instrument or tool you’re accustomed to using—allowing you to distinguish a high-quality piece from an inferior one. Appraising common or familiar items has a DC 8. A failure means you estimate the value at 10% to 150% (2d8-1 × 10%) of the true value. Appraising a rare or exotic item has a DC 16, and failure indicates you cannot determine the item’s value.

An Arts check can also be used to detect a forgery.

**Livelihood**: You can practice your craft to earn a living. With a week of work and an Arts check, you earn 100 Ryos for each point your check exceeds 15. For example, if your final result is 19, you earn 400 Ryos for the week’s work.

This Skill requires an artisan’s kit. Without it, you suffer a -5 penalty to the check.
