*Intelligence*

Sciences measures a character’s knowledge of Biology (animals and basic human anatomy), Herbalism (plants and herbs), and Geography (terrains and climates).

**Measuring Knowledge**: Sometimes, a Sciences check isn’t needed. Instead, the Skill level determines whether a character knows about a specific topic.
