*Intelligence / Trained*

Occultism functions similarly to Culture but pertains exclusively to secretive or hard-to-access information, such as recognizing forbidden or clan-exclusive techniques, or knowing obscure stories, legends, or secrets of noble or prominent families.

**Measuring Knowledge**: Sometimes, an Occultism check isnâ€™t needed. Instead, the Skill level determines whether a character knows about a specific topic.
