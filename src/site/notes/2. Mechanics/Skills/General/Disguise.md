*Perception*

With some makeup and a few tricks, you can alter your appearance or that of another person.

Make a Disguise check opposed by the Notice check of anyone observing you. On a success, the person believes your disguise; if you fail, they notice something wrong with your appearance.

Complex disguises impose penalties: -2 for disguising as the opposite gender, -2 for a different race, and -2 for a significantly different age. These penalties are cumulative.

Pretending to be a specific, known person is harder, and those familiar with that person receive bonuses to their Notice checks: +2 if they only know the person casually, +4 for a friend, and +8 for someone very close.

Creating a disguise requires at least ten minutes.
