*Perception*

You can guide a group through the wilderness, recognize and follow tracks, or avoid natural hazards.

**Survival**: You can navigate without getting lost by succeeding on a daily check, finding food and safe shelter for yourself and a small group of up to five others.

The difficulty depends on the environment: DC 12 for plains and coastal areas, DC 16 for forests or swamps, and DC 20 for deserts or mountains. Particularly arid or barren regions and bad weather (snow, storms, etc.) impose a -4 penalty (cumulative).

**Follow Tracks**: The difficulty varies based on the terrain—DC 8 for soft ground (snow, mud), DC 12 for standard ground (grass, dirt), and DC 16 for hard ground (rock or indoor flooring).

You gain a +1 bonus for every three creatures in the group being tracked. You suffer a -1 penalty for each day since the tracks were made and a -4 penalty in poor visibility (night, rain, fog).

You need one check to find the tracks and an additional check for each day of pursuit. If you fail, you can try again by spending another day (but note that the DC increases each day).

**Track vs. Stealth**: You can also use this Skill to pursue creatures that have fled and hidden using their Stealth. In this case, your Track check is opposed by the creature’s Stealth check.
