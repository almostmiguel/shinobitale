*Intelligence*

This Skill is used to maintain a character’s focus and mental concentration.

Whenever there is a potential distraction (e.g., damage, turbulent weather, sudden movements), the character must succeed on a Focus check to continue performing any task requiring full attention, such as casting a technique, sustaining an active technique, or using a Skill that provokes opportunity attacks (e.g., Mechanisms).

Generally, whenever an action would provoke opportunity attacks, the character must make a Focus check to avoid distraction. Making a Focus check is a free action.

On a successful Focus check, the character can proceed with the action normally. If they fail, the task automatically fails and is lost.

**Distraction Check**: The difficulty of the check depends on the distraction that occurred during the task:

- Damage: DC 7 + the attack’s damage (excluding modifiers).
- Technique causing distraction: Use the technique’s own DC.
- Windy or stormy rain/snow: DC 4.
- Cyclone, hailstorm, or sandstorm: DC 8.
- Violent movement (e.g., on a boat in a storm): DC 12.
- Being grappled (only for techniques not requiring gestures): DC 16.

**Close Combat Check**: When you want to use a ranged technique while within an enemy’s melee range (typically 1m), you must succeed on a Focus check to use the technique (DC 3 + the Melee Combat level of the most accurate enemy). If you fail, the enemy disrupts you in some way, the technique fails, and any costs paid for it are lost.

If the nearby enemy is not a threat (e.g., under the effect of a technique limiting their offensive actions), the Game Master may optionally waive this check for the player.

Optionally, instead of making a Focus check, you can choose to take a -3 penalty to the accuracy of your Ranged Combat (RC) check (if the technique requires an attack roll).
