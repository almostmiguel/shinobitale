*Dexterity*

You can escape from ropes, nets, and handcuffs as a full action. For ropes, make an Escape check opposed by the Dexterity check of the person who tied you (they receive a +8 bonus to their check, as tying someone is easier than escaping). You can also escape from nets (DC 16) and standard prisoner handcuffs (DC 24).

Additionally, you can use the Escape Skill to break free from a grapple maneuver (check against a DC equal to 4 + the enemyâ€™s Melee Combat level for grappling).
