This book does not include an extensive list of jutsus by default. Why? Many jutsus are quite similar, differing only in scope, damage, or appearance. For example, **Katon: Ryuuka no Jutsu**, **Karyudan**, and **Karyu Endan** are all flamethrower techniques that vary primarily in the shape of the flames.

The situation is similar for **Taijutsu**. A trip to knock down an opponent is a common close-combat move, but in the **Gouken** style, it’s called **Konoha Reppuu**. Likewise, a combo of kicks is a standard maneuver, but in Gouken it’s named **Konoha Daisenpuu**. From one fighting style to another, the difference is often only in the appearance of the technique, while the mechanics remain similar.

To reflect this, the game uses **Powers** and **Feats** to simulate these techniques:

- **Ninjutsu**: Primarily represented by **Powers**, with some techniques covered by shinobi **Feats** (e.g., Clones).
- **Genjutsu**: Represented by the shinobi **Feats** **Fascinate** and **Mirage**. Characters focused on this style can also purchase the restricted **Magen (Demonic Illusion)** power.
- **Taijutsu**: Simulated through **Feats**, especially maneuver-based ones. Certain powers, like **Hachimon Tonkou**, can enhance this style.
- **Clan Techniques, Kekkei Genkai, and Hijutsu**: All treated as **Powers** and **Feats** available for purchase by the player.

Available **Powers** can be found in the **Clans**, **Hijutsu**, and **Powers** chapters.

**Basic Jutsus**: In addition to Powers, there are basic techniques every shinobi knows, which are free. These are listed at the end of the **Jutsus**.

### JUTSU RANKS

In _Naruto_, jutsus are classified into ranks from **E** (the most basic) to **S** (the most difficult and powerful). Below is a reference table for classifying techniques based on their **Power Level** or **Attribute Level**. This is a guideline, not a prerequisite rule.

| **Rank** | **Power Level**  | **Attribute Level** |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| **E**    | 0 (Basic Jutsus) | 0–1                 |
| **D**    | 1–2              | 2–5                 |
| **C**    | 3–4              | 6–9                 |
| **B**    | 5–6              | 10–13               |
| **A**    | 7–8              | 14–17               |
| **S**    | 9–10             | 18–20               |

### UNDERSTANDING POWERS

In this game, **Powers** provide a collection of techniques or a single, more potent technique compared to **[[2. Mechanics/Character Rules/7. - Feats\|Feats]]**. For example, the **[[2. Mechanics/Powers/Suiton\|Suiton]]** power allows you to perform various water-based techniques, such as creating water dragons to attack enemies or forming water walls to block opposing techniques.

All powers in this chapter are **common**, meaning they can be purchased by any character, whether they belong to a clan/hijutsu or not, unless the clan/hijutsu explicitly prohibits it.

In this game, you don’t buy pre-made jutsus. Instead, you purchase and advance **Powers**. To illustrate, let’s take **Fire Element Ninjutsu** as an example:

The **Katon** power consolidates all fire-based techniques. It starts at **level 1** and can progress to **level 10**. Higher levels unlock better and more powerful techniques, such as:

- **Katon 1**: Hiakahou (Red Fire Cannon)
- **Katon 2**: Shoukakyuu no Jutsu (Small Fireball Technique)
- **Katon 3**: Housenka no Jutsu (Mystical Fire Phoenix Technique)
- **Katon 4**: Goukakyuu no Jutsu (Great Fireball Technique)
- **Katon 5**: Ryuuka no Jutsu (Fire Dragon Technique)
- **Katon 10**: Gōenka (Blazing Flower)

Similarly, clan techniques, like the Nara clan’s shadow techniques, are grouped under the **Kagejutsu** power. Advancing in Kagejutsu grants new, more powerful techniques:

- **Kagejutsu 1**: Kage Shibari (Shadow Binding)
- **Kagejutsu 3**: Kage Mane (Shadow Imitation)
- **Kagejutsu 5**: Kage Kubishibari (Shadow Strangulation)
- **Kagejutsu 6**: Kage Nui (Shadow Stitching)

A **Power** is a set of techniques or effects. Each level increase grants new techniques or effects. Powers are divided into:

- **Powers with Techniques**: Clan powers (e.g., Kagejutsu), **Fuuinjutsu** provide specific techniques every one or two levels.
- **Powers with Effects**: Elemental Ninjutsu (e.g., Katon, Suiton), **Ninpou**, and **Magen** don’t provide pre-made jutsus but offer a list of **Effects** that grow stronger with each level. Players can use these effects to recreate anime techniques or create original ones, as long as they follow the power’s damage and range rules.

For example, with **Katon level 4** and the **Destructive Breath** effect, you can recreate **Goukakyuu no Jutsu** or invent a new fire technique, adhering to the power’s rules. Examples:

- **Katon 1**: Hiakahou (Red Fire Cannon) – using the **Cannon** effect
- **Katon 2**: Shoukakyuu no Jutsu (Small Fireball Technique) – using the **Orb** effect
- **Katon 3**: Housenka no Jutsu (Mystical Fire Phoenix Technique) – using the **Arrows** effect
- **Katon 4**: Goukakyuu no Jutsu (Great Fireball Technique) – using the **Destructive Breath** effect
- **Katon 5**: Ryuuka no Jutsu (Fire Dragon Technique) – using the **Missile** effect

**What is a Technique?** A technique is either a pre-made jutsu provided by a power (e.g., **Kage Mane**) or a jutsu you create using a generic effect (e.g., **Goukakyuu no Jutsu** from the **Destructive Breath** effect). Some **Feats**, like **Clone**, also provide techniques.

You don’t pay extra to learn pre-made techniques; you only need the required power level and any additional prerequisites.

Even if a power doesn’t list a technique or effect for a specific level, it can still be advanced, as all powers have parameters (e.g., damage, range, or resistance difficulty) that improve with level.

### PURCHASING POWERS

- **Prerequisites**: Some powers require specific conditions (e.g., **Spirit 8**). **Accuracy bonuses** (e.g., from the **[[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Specialist\|Specialist]]** feat) don’t count toward meeting prerequisites.
- **Cost**: Each level of a power costs **1 point**, starting from zero. For example:
    - **Katon 1**: 1 point
    - **Katon 2**: 2 points total (1 additional point)
    - **Katon 3**: 3 points total, and so on.
- **Power Limit**: A power’s level cannot exceed **half the Campaign Level** (rounded down). For example, in a **CL 11** game, powers are capped at **level 5**.

### USING POWERS OR TECHNIQUES

When using a power or technique, follow its description for rules on test type, range, damage, area of effect, etc. The following explains how to interpret these descriptions:

#### Types of Techniques:

- **Projectile**: Launches one or more projectiles at targets. Any ranged attack that deals damage without an area of effect is a projectile. Examples: **Cannon**, **Ray**, **Arrows** effects.
- **Area Attack**: Affects an area, potentially hitting multiple targets (allies or enemies). The size and shape are specified in the technique or power description. Examples: **Destructive Breath**, **Missile** effects.
- **Support**: Personal-range techniques that benefit the user or modify their fighting style, or aid allies. Examples: **Energize** effect, **Iryou Ninjutsu** power. Support techniques that enhance melee attacks cannot be used simultaneously (e.g., **Energize** with **Juuken** or **Chakra Scalpel**).
- **Melee Attack**: Close-combat techniques that deal damage, typically using standard armed damage calculations. Common in restricted powers. Examples: **Hakke Rokujuuyon Shou** (Hyuuga Clan), **Nikudan Sensha** (Akimichi Clan).
- **Touch Technique**: Requires touching the target to deal damage or apply another effect. Damage is calculated uniquely per technique. Examples: **Lightning Blade** effect, **Rasengan**, or **Magen** effects via touch.

#### Action:

The action required (standard, movement, partial, free, reaction, full, or multi-round) is specified in the power’s description. Multi-round powers require **concentration** until the next turn. Some powers have multiple functions with different action types. See the **Combat** rules for details on actions.

#### Hand Seals:

All powers and techniques require hand seals or gestures unless stated otherwise. Both hands must be free to perform seals.

#### Chakra Cost:

Generally, the chakra cost equals the power’s level (e.g., **Iryou Ninjutsu level 4** costs 4 chakra). Some powers or techniques have unique costs or none (e.g., **Hachimon Tonkou**, which damages **Hit Points** instead). Chakra is paid once when initiating a technique, even for sustained effects. If the technique fails or is interrupted, the chakra is not refunded.

#### Range:

- **Personal**: Affects the user. No test is needed unless specified.
- **Touch**: Affects a target/people you can touch. Touching an unwilling target requires a **Hand-to-Hand Combat (CC)** test against their defensive action. You cannot perform a melee attack and a touch technique simultaneously, nor use two touch techniques at once.
- **Ranged**: Used at a distance, with a range in meters specified by the power. Requires a **Ranged Combat (CD)** test, though some powers (e.g., **Magen**) don’t need a hit test. If you’re within 1m of an enemy, ranged tests take a **-3 accuracy penalty**, or a **Focus** test is needed for techniques without a hit test.

#### Target:

The target can be the environment, one or more people, or the user. Check the power’s description for specifics. Non-area attacks can be blocked with a **Block** reaction if the defender has an appropriate weapon (e.g., a special weapon or **Energize** effect).

#### Area of Effect:

Some powers affect an area, impacting everyone within it (allies or enemies). **Block** cannot be used against area attacks, but **Dodge** or **Anticipate** can, unless movement is restricted:

- **Grabbed, restrained, or immobilized targets**: Cannot use **Anticipate**; **Dodge** is fixed at **9**.
- **Prone targets**: Take a **-3 accuracy penalty** to **Dodge** and **Anticipate**.

Area effects originate from:

- The user, extending to the power’s full range.
- Around the user, up to the effect’s size limit.
- A point in front of the user within range.

**Area Types**:

- **Cone**: Extends from the user in a cone shape, with length and width defined by the power.
- **Circle**: A circular area with a diameter defined by the power, centered on the user or a point within range.
- **Cylinder**: A circular area with a defined diameter and height, centered on the user or a point within range.
- **Sphere**: A spherical area with a defined diameter, centered on or originating from the user.
- **Line**: A 1m-wide straight path with a length defined by the power, extending from the user.
- **Wave**: A straight path with defined length, width, and height, extending from the user.

The entire area must stay within the power’s maximum range.

#### Dodging Area Attacks:

In _Naruto_’s shonen style, characters can dodge area attacks with **Dodge** or **Anticipate** without physically moving far, thanks to exaggerated leaps or maneuvers. Extremely large or powerful attacks (e.g., **Destructive Breath level 7** or **Bijuudama**) may have specific rules preventing dodging.

#### Duration:

- **Instantaneous**: The effect happens and ends immediately, though its results may persist (e.g., a fireball that disappears after hitting).
- **Concentration**: Lasts while you maintain focus, requiring a **standard action** each turn. Distractions (e.g., taking damage, adverse conditions) may break concentration, requiring a **Concentration** skill test (difficulty **9 + 2× power level**, or **9 + CL** if no level applies). If you fail or become incapacitated, the power stops. You cannot attack or use other techniques while concentrating.
- **Sustained**: Lasts as long as desired, requiring a **partial action** each turn to maintain. Stops if you become incapacitated.
- **Continuous**: Lasts for a scene or a set number of turns without effort. Remains active until you deactivate it or become unconscious.
- **Permanent**: Always active and cannot be deactivated, even if unconscious, unless specified.

#### Turn and Round Counting:

Unless stated otherwise, effects lasting multiple turns or rounds are counted based on the **target’s turns** (user for benefits, victim for penalties). For example:

- A **+1 bonus for 2 turns** lasts from the user’s current turn to the end of their next turn.
- A **-1 penalty for 2 turns** lasts from the victim’s first affected turn to the end of their next turn.

#### Deactivating Powers:

Deactivating **continuous**, **sustained**, or **concentration** powers is a **free action**, unless specified otherwise.

#### Hit Test:

- **Personal-range powers** don’t require a hit test unless stated.
- **Touch or ranged powers** require a **CC** (touch) or **CD** (ranged) test if the target resists. For multi-target attacks, one hit test is rolled, but each target defends individually.
- **Environment-targeting powers** don’t require hit tests or allow defenses.

#### Resistance Test:

Some powers (e.g., **Magen**) don’t require a hit test but allow the target a **resistance test** against a difficulty specified in the power’s description. If multiple test options exist, the target chooses which to use.

### ELEMENTAL AFFINITY

A character can only purchase **one basic elemental power** (e.g., Katon, Suiton). However, upon reaching **Spirit 10** (typically at Jounin level), they gain enough experience to master a second element and can purchase another elemental power.

Elemental power purchases are generally unrestricted, but the Game Master and players may optionally decide to randomly assign elements (if the clan/hijutsu allows). Special cases like **combined element hijutsu** (e.g., **Mokuton**), the **Versatility** power (**Tensai**), or the **Natural Element: Katon** feat (**[[2. Mechanics/Clans/Uchiha\|Uchiha]] Clan**) have unique rules for elemental affinity limits.

You can purchase an elemental power even with a clan or hijutsu, unless the clan/hijutsu imposes restrictions.

---

### ELEMENTAL CONFRONTATION

The five basic elements have advantages and disadvantages against each other, which matters when elemental techniques clash (e.g., a defensive elemental technique vs. an attacking one, or canceling one elemental technique with another). The diagram of the five elements shows arrows pointing from the advantaged element to the disadvantaged one.

When rival elements clash, the disadvantaged element’s **hardness** and **damage** are **halved**. For example, a **Raiton (Lightning)** technique against a **Doton (Earth)** barrier reduces the barrier’s hardness by half, as Raiton has an advantage over Doton.

**Non-elemental techniques** (e.g., **Ninpou**) and **elemental Kekkei Genkai** (e.g., **Mokuton**) have no inherent advantages or disadvantages unless specified.

---

### ELEMENTAL COMBO

Upon reaching **Spirit or Intelligence 12**, you can combine two techniques from different elements to create a new one. Requirements:

- Possess two different elemental powers (or one element and **Ninpou**).
- Have the **Accelerated Technique** feat to use both techniques in one round.
- Alternatively, perform the combo with an ally who has a different elemental power.

The combo must have logical compatibility (e.g., using **Raiton** to spread electricity through a **Suiton** technique) and requires Game Master approval.

#### Effects Used:

Combine two **Ninpou** effects from different elements (exclusive elemental effects cannot be used). Only **standard action**, **instantaneous**, damage-dealing effects can be combined, and their levels cannot differ by more than 1.

#### Primary and Secondary Effect:

Choose one effect as the **primary**, which determines all parameters (accuracy, damage, range, area, hardness, resistance difficulty). The **secondary effect** only adds its benefits, not affecting the primary’s parameters. For example, combining **Suiton’s Destructive Breath (level 7)** (primary) with **Fuuton’s Torrent (level 6)** (secondary) uses Destructive Breath’s parameters and adds Torrent’s push effect.

#### Action:

Performing a combo alone is a **full action** and requires the **Accelerated Technique** feat. With an ally, it’s a **standard action** for both.

#### Chakra Cost:

Pay the normal chakra cost for both effects. Only the primary effect’s parameters matter (increasing the secondary effect’s chakra doesn’t boost damage or resistance difficulty).

#### Tests:

Use one hit test based on the primary effect’s accuracy. For resistance tests, the target makes separate tests for each effect per their original rules.

#### Combo with Ally:

Follows the same rules. One player chooses the primary effect, the other the secondary (or vice versa). A single hit test is made, but the accuracy difference between you and your ally cannot exceed **3**.
