This book does not include an extensive list of jutsus by default. Why? Many jutsus are quite similar, differing only in scope, damage, or appearance. For example, **Katon: Ryuuka no Jutsu**, **Karyudan**, and **Karyu Endan** are all flamethrower techniques that vary primarily in the shape of the flames.

The situation is similar for **Taijutsu**. A trip to knock down an opponent is a common close-combat move, but in the **Gouken** style, it’s called **Konoha Reppuu**. Likewise, a combo of kicks is a standard maneuver, but in Gouken it’s named **Konoha Daisenpuu**. From one fighting style to another, the difference is often only in the appearance of the technique, while the mechanics remain similar.

To reflect this, the game uses **Powers** and **Feats** to simulate these techniques:

- **Ninjutsu**: Primarily represented by **Powers**, with some techniques covered by shinobi **Feats** (e.g., Clones).
- **Genjutsu**: Represented by the shinobi **Feats** **Fascinate** and **Mirage**. Characters focused on this style can also purchase the restricted **Magen (Demonic Illusion)** power.
- **Taijutsu**: Simulated through **Feats**, especially maneuver-based ones. Certain powers, like **Hachimon Tonkou**, can enhance this style.
- **Clan Techniques, Kekkei Genkai, and Hijutsu**: All treated as **Powers** and **Aptitudes** available for purchase by the player.

Available **Powers** can be found in the **Clans**, **Hijutsu**, and **Powers** chapters.

**Basic Jutsus**: In addition to Powers, there are basic techniques every shinobi knows, which are free. These are listed at the end of the **Jutsus**.

### JUTSU RANKS

In _Naruto_, jutsus are classified into ranks from **E** (the most basic) to **S** (the most difficult and powerful). Below is a reference table for classifying techniques based on their **Power Level** or **Attribute Level**. This is a guideline, not a prerequisite rule.

|**Rank**|**Power Level**|**Attribute Level**|
|---|---|---|
|**E**|0 (Basic Jutsus)|0–1|
|**D**|1–2|2–5|
|**C**|3–4|6–9|
|**B**|5–6|10–13|
|**A**|7–8|14–17|
|**S**|9–10|18–20|
