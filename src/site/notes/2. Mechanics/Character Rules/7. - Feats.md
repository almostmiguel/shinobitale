**Feats** are enhancements for your character, offering even more specialized abilities than **Skills**. They grant a variety of benefits, ranging from allowing you to reroll certain skill checks to unlocking new techniques—such as creating duplicates of yourself.

### **Acquiring Feats**

**Prerequisites:**  
Some feats can only be acquired once specific requirements are met. For example, the _Accelerated Technique_ feat requires **Spirit 12**.  
Accuracy bonuses (such as those granted by the _Specialist_ feat) **do not** count toward meeting prerequisites.

**Free Feats:**  
At character creation, you may choose **3 feats for free**. The following pages provide a list of all standard feats, indicating which can be selected as free choices.

In addition, you may select a **clan-restricted** or **Hijutsu** feat as a free feat if its prerequisites can be met by a **Rank 4 Genin**, meaning:

- Attributes/Skills at **Level 4 or lower**
    
- Combat Skills at **Level 9 or lower**
    
- Powers at **Level 2 or lower**
    

**Additional Feats:**  
You can also spend **Power Points** to acquire additional feats. Each feat costs **2 Power Points**.

**Stacking Feats:**  
Identical feats **do not stack**. You cannot purchase the same feat more than once **unless** the feat’s description specifically allows it or it’s classified as a **Generic Feat** (see below).  
This rule also applies to feats **granted for free**. For instance, a character with _Nidan Sharingan_ receives the _Insight_ feat for free. If they purchase _Insight_ again, they do **not** gain the bonus twice.  
If a feat provides **cumulative benefits**, that will be explicitly stated in its description.

**Generic Feats:**  
These allow you to choose a **category** to receive the benefit (e.g., _Expert_, _Greater Resistance_, _Specialist_).  
Generic feats **can** be purchased multiple times, but always for **different categories**.  
For example, you may take _Specialist_ to gain +1 accuracy with weapons from one category, but you can’t take it twice for a +2 with the same weapon. You **can**, however, take it again for a different weapon category.  
Restricted feats can only be taken more than once if the text explicitly permits it.

**Evolving Feats:**  
Some feats can be **leveled up** by taking them multiple times. These _Evolving Feats_ grant greater benefits at higher levels (e.g., Level 2, Level 3, etc.). The benefits of each tier are described within the feat itself.

### **Types of Feats**

- **Combat Feats:** Directly affect combat performance, typically providing bonuses to accuracy, damage, or action economy.
    
- **Maneuver Feats:** Grant new melee combat techniques. 
    
- **Technique Feats:** Modify how the character uses their techniques, enhancing destructive power or versatility.
    
- **Shinobi Feats:** Grant access to shinobi-style abilities, such as clone techniques or illusions. To use a shinobi feat, you must also follow the rules for **Powers and Techniques** (pg. 86).
    
- **General Feats:** Provide various utility bonuses that don't fall under the other categories.
