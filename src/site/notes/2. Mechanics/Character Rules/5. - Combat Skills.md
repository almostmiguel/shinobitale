Combat Skills are used when your character attacks or defends during a fight. There are four: Melee Combat, Ranged Combat, Dodge, and Anticipate Movement.

### DEFINING COMBAT SKILLS

**Combat Skill Level**: Attribute + Base Value.  
Initially, all Combat Skills have a Base Value of 3. The Attribute added varies for each skill:

- **Melee Combat (MC)** = Base Value 3 + Strength
- **Ranged Combat (RC)** = Base Value 3 + Dexterity
- **Dodge (DOD)** = Base Value 3 + Dexterity
- **Anticipate Movement (AM)** = Base Value 3 + Perception

You may reallocate up to 2 points among the Base Values of these skills, transferring points from one skill to another.  
For example, if you want a character focused on dodging, you could take 2 points from Anticipate Movement and add them to Dodge, resulting in Base Values of: MC 3 / RC 3 / DOD 5 / AM 1.  
Alternatively, for a highly offensive character, you could take 1 point from Dodge and 1 point from Anticipate Movement, adding them to Melee Combat and Ranged Combat, resulting in Base Values of: MC 4 / RC 4 / DOD 2 / AM 2.

The Base Value cannot be changed later, though the Game Master may allow exceptions.
