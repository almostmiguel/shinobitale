In this game, **Clan Techniques**, **Kekkei Genkai**, and **Hijutsu** are treated as **powers** and **feats** available for purchase by the player.

If you choose a **clan**, your character gains access to purchase the **exclusive feats and powers** of that clan. If you opt not to choose a clan, you can instead purchase **Hijutsu**, which come with their own restricted aptitudes and powers. Note that selecting a clan or hijutsu **does not cost points**; it simply unlocks the ability to purchase the associated powers and aptitudes.

- **Clan characters** cannot purchase **Hijutsu**.
- **Non-clan characters** cannot purchase more than one type of **Hijutsu**, unless the specific Hijutsu rules allow it (e.g., **Hachimon** or **Senjutsu**).
- Clans and Hijutsu may have **restricted powers**, **restricted aptitudes**, or both.
- You **cannot mix** powers and aptitudes from different clans or Hijutsu, unless the specific Hijutsu permits it. For example:
    - You cannot combine **Hyuuga aptitudes** with **Inuzuka powers**.
    - However, you can combine **Hibon Ninpou** with **Tensai**, if allowed by the rules.
- When a clan offers multiple Hijutsu options, you **cannot mix** them either.
