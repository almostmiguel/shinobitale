Attributes represent a character’s basic physical and mental capabilities. They form the foundation for defining other characteristics. The Attributes are: Strength, Dexterity, Perception, Intelligence, Vigor, and Spirit.

### BUYING ATTRIBUTE LEVELS

**Cost**: Purchasing 1 level in an Attribute costs exactly 1 point. All Attributes start at level zero.  
For example, if you have Strength 0 and want Strength 3, you must spend 3 Attribute points. Similarly, if you have Dexterity 4 and want Dexterity 9, you must spend 5 points.

**Maximum Limit**: An Attribute’s level cannot exceed the Campaign Level. Thus, in a CL 11 game, a character’s Attributes cannot exceed level 11.

**Minimum Limit**: In the point allocation tables, you may have noticed a column called “Minimum Attribute.” When purchasing Attributes, players must meet this minimum value for all Attributes. In other words, points must first be spent on the lowest Attributes to reach the minimum before freely distributing the remaining points.
