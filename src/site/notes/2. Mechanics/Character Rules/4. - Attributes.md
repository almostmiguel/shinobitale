Attributes represent a character’s basic physical and mental capabilities. They form the foundation for defining other characteristics. The Attributes are: [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]], [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]], [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Perception\|Perception]], [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]], [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Vigor\|Vigor]], and [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]].

### BUYING ATTRIBUTE LEVELS

**Cost**: Purchasing 1 level in an **Attribute** costs exactly 1 point. All Attributes start at level zero.  
For example, if you have [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] 0 and want [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] 3, you must spend 3 Attribute points. Similarly, if you have [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] 4 and want [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] 9, you must spend 5 points.

**Maximum Limit**: An Attribute’s level cannot exceed the Campaign Level. Thus, in a CL 11 game, a character’s Attributes cannot exceed level 11.

**Minimum Limit**: In the point allocation tables, you may have noticed a column called “Minimum Attribute.” When purchasing Attributes, players must meet this minimum value for all Attributes. In other words, points must first be spent on the lowest Attributes to reach the minimum before freely distributing the remaining points.
