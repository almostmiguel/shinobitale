This section covers the rules and descriptions for equipment a character can possess, with tables listing all purchasable items at the chapter’s end.

### INITIAL MONEY

The **Ryo** is the standard currency in the Naruto world. Player characters (PJs) start with an amount of money and items based on their **shinobi rank** (see table). Additional funds can be earned through mission rewards.

|**Shinobi Rank**|**Initial Money (Ryo)**|
|---|---|
|Genin|100|
|Chuunin|1,000|
|Special Jounin|5,000|
|Jounin|13,000|
|Elite Jounin|36,000|
|Sannin/Kage|88,000

### INITIAL EQUIPMENT

As ninjas affiliated with a village’s military, characters receive necessary equipment and weapons from their village at **no cost**. This includes items like **kunai**, **shuriken**, **explosive tags**, or even a **katana** required for a mission. However, the village provides only what is strictly necessary, typically limited by what the ninja can carry.

To acquire additional items or those not typically provided by the village (e.g., personal or specialized gear), characters must spend their **initial money** or **mission earnings**. Items can be sold for **half their value**, though better prices may require a **Bargain** skill test.

---

### ITEM SLOTS

The number of items a character can carry is measured in **item slots**.

For example, carrying **18 shuriken** requires a container like a **belt pouch**, which provides **1 item slot**. Equipment such as **pouches**, **backpacks**, or **holsters** grant slots to store items:

- A **holster** (1 slot) can hold **10 kunai**.
- A **belt pouch** (1 slot) can hold **18 shuriken**.
- Weapons like **swords** or **bows** occupy **1 slot** and include sheaths or quivers.

You can mix multiple types of simple throwing weapons or explosives in a single slot, carrying **half the normal amount** of each (e.g., **5 kunai + 9 shuriken** in 1 slot).

**Slot Limit**: Characters can carry up to **3 slots** without penalties. Exceeding this reduces **movement** by **3m** and applies a **-1 accuracy penalty** to tests requiring **mobility**, **Strength**, or **Dexterity** per extra slot. Movement cannot drop below **10m** due to this rule.

**Negligible Items**: Items like books, keychains, or photos don’t count toward slots and are carried in pockets. The Game Master determines what qualifies as negligible, depending on the context (e.g., a small travel ration might be negligible unless survival and food management are mission-critical).

## WEAPONS

All ninjas use weapons, even if just a simple kunai. Weapons are divided into categories based on type and ease of use.

### WEAPON TYPES

Weapons are classified into **Natural**, **Simple**, **Martial**, and **Special** categories:

- **Natural Weapons**: Body parts like claws or fangs, specific to a creature’s description. Their use and damage are detailed in the creature’s profile.
- **Simple Weapons**: Easy to use, accessible to any intelligent creature capable of handling tools (e.g., **kunai**, **shuriken**). All characters can use simple weapons without training.
- **Martial Weapons**: Familiar to combat-trained individuals (e.g., **bows**, **swords**, **axes**). Requires the **Weapon Training** feat to wield effectively.
- **Special Weapons**: Rare and difficult to master (e.g., **Samehada**), with unique rules. Requires the **Weapon Training** feat.

Using a weapon without proficiency incurs a **-3 attack penalty**. This also applies when using a weapon with the **off-hand**, unless the character has the **Two-Weapon Fighting** feat.

#### MELEE WEAPONS

Melee weapons are used for close combat and divided into four types:

- **Light**: Used one-handed, benefits from the **Finesse** aptitude. Requires **Strength or Dexterity 8+**. Throwing weapons usable in melee (e.g., kunai) are light, with no attribute requirement, and benefit from **Finesse**.
- **Medium**: More lethal and heavier than light weapons, used one-handed. Requires **Strength or Dexterity 10+**.
- **Long**: Two-handed weapons that double the attacker’s natural reach (e.g., **2m** for small/medium characters, **4m** for large, **6m** for huge). Requires **Strength or Dexterity 10+**.
- **Heavy**: Two-handed, high-damage weapons that cannot be used with maneuver aptitudes unless explicitly allowed. Requires **Strength 12+**.

Melee attack damage is calculated as **weapon damage + half Strength level**.

#### RANGED WEAPONS

Ranged weapons are either **thrown** or **fired**:

- **Thrown**: The weapon itself is thrown (e.g., kunai). Throwing a non-throwing weapon incurs a **-3 accuracy penalty** and has a **3m max range**.
- **Fired**: The weapon shoots a projectile (e.g., bow). Requires **Dexterity 8+** for simple fired weapons and **10+** for martial ones.

Ranged attack damage is **weapon damage + half Dexterity level**.

**Ammunition**: Fired weapons (e.g., bows, crossbows) require ammunition (e.g., arrows, bolts), which shares the weapon’s slot.

#### IMPROVISED WEAPONS

Using objects not designed for combat (e.g., chairs, broken bottles) incurs a **-3 accuracy penalty**. Damage and critical range are determined by the Game Master based on size and material (e.g., a chair leg might deal **+3 damage** like a club, a broken bottle **+1** like a kunai).

### WEAPON QUALITIES

- **Price**: Cost per unit, including basic accessories (e.g., sheaths for melee, quivers for fired weapons). Throwing weapons and other items require separate holsters or pouches.
- **Damage**: Damage dealt on a successful hit. Listed damage assumes a **Medium-sized** character; larger/smaller creatures adjust damage via the **Size Table**. Throwing weapons require the listed quantity to deal full damage (e.g., **3 shuriken** for listed damage).
- **Dual Weapons (D)**: Have two damage values. Use the first for single-end attacks; sum both for dual-end attacks. Requires **Two-Weapon Fighting** to use as two weapons.
- **Critical**: A roll of **15–16** is a critical hit. Some weapons have a larger critical range (e.g., a scimitar crits on **14–16**).
- **Range**: The distance a ranged weapon can attack without penalty (e.g., **25m** for a light crossbow). Up to **double the range**, take a **-1 accuracy penalty**; up to **quadruple the range**, take a **-3 penalty**. Beyond quadruple, attacks are impossible.
- **Slots**: Indicates weight/volume (e.g., **10 kunai/1 slot** means 10 kunai take 1 slot; **1 greatsword/2 slots** means 1 greatsword takes 2 slots). Items marked “—” are negligible unless carried in large quantities.
- **Size**: Weapons are sized for specific creatures (e.g., Medium for humans). Using a weapon one size category larger or smaller incurs a **-3 accuracy penalty**; two or more sizes different cannot be used.
- **Type**: Weapons deal **slashing**, **piercing**, or **bludgeoning** damage. Some creatures resist specific damage types.

## ARMOR AND SUITS

In the Naruto world, armors are uncommon because ninjas prioritize mobility. Most prefer **leather vests** for chest protection and extra pockets for small items. However, older ninjas or those from past eras often used heavier armors, a practice some still maintain.

#### TYPES OF ARMOR

Armors are divided into two categories based on ease of use, weight, protection, and mobility:

- **Light Armors**: Typically made of leather, offering minimal protection but low cost and high mobility. Donning or removing a light armor takes a **full action**. All characters can use light armors without restriction.
- **Heavy Armors**: Made of metal scales, plates, or other rigid materials, providing significant protection but severely restricting movement. Requires **Strength 10** or **Vigor 15**.
    - **Armor Penalty**: Heavy armors impose an **accuracy penalty** on **Dodge**, **Dexterity**, **Acrobatics**, **Athletics**, **Escape**, and **Stealth** tests. The penalty has two values: one in parentheses (applied without the **Use Heavy Armor** aptitude) and one outside (applied with the aptitude).
    - Donning or removing a heavy armor takes **5 minutes**.

#### ARMOR QUALITIES

- **Price**: The cost for a complete armor set. Individual armor pieces are not typically sold separately and offer no protection alone. Prices vary based on location, quality, or **Bargain** skill tests.
- **Absorption Bonus**: Armors provide **absorption points**, acting as extra **Hit Points**. Damage is first subtracted from absorption; only after absorption reaches zero is Hit Points reduced. When absorption is depleted, the armor becomes unusable (see Object Hardness and Breaking, p. 274). Heavier armors have higher absorption. **Multiple armors cannot be worn together**.
- **Armor Penalty**: Due to weight and rigidity, armors impose penalties on **Dodge** and tests for **Dexterity**, **Acrobatics**, **Athletics**, **Escape**, and **Stealth**.
- **Slots**: Armors affect carrying capacity. Light armors often include pockets, granting **+1 item slot**, while heavy armors reduce capacity by **-1 or -2 slots**.

- **(MC or RC)** indicates the weapon can be used in melee (Hand-to-Hand Combat) or thrown (Ranged Combat).
- Thrown weapons require the listed quantity (e.g., 3 shuriken) to deal the indicated damage.
