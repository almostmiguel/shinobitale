The first thing to define is the shinobi rank of the character, which can be Academy Student, Genin, Chuunin, Special Jounin, Jounin, Elite Jounin, Sannin, or Kage. Keep in mind that these ranks aren't acquired when a certain CL is reached, these are simply examples of how powerful shinobi in these ranks should be. (Usually, your Game Master will inform you of the Shinobi Rank your character starts with.)

- **Academy Students (CL 4)**: This is the first step for a ninja. All shinobi begin at the academy to learn the "foundation" of what it truly means to be a ninja. It is at the academy that aspiring ninjas learn all basic jutsus. If the campaign starts with students, use the same point allocation as Genins but with no points for Powers.

- **Genins (CL 4)**: Shinobi who have graduated from the ninja academy. Most Genins use basic techniques, many of which are learned at the academy, but some develop their own techniques or, if applicable, techniques from their advanced bloodline. Typically, groups of three Genins are formed and trained by a Jounin. They receive very easy and "boring" missions, such as walking a wealthy person’s dogs, searching for a lost cat, rescuing a runaway animal, or helping people with planting and harvesting. Only after considerable time do Genins begin to apply their skills to more complex missions, ranging from D-rank to B-rank missions.

- **Chuunins (CL 8)**: After participating in the Chuunin Exam (Chuunin Shiken), a Genin is judged for their strength and intelligence by the Kages and other high-ranking judges to become a Chuunin. They are now qualified to lead a group of Genins during extracurricular missions, such as when the village is attacked. They may be sent on missions alone or in groups (typically of four members).

- **Special Jounins (CL 10)**: Also known as Tokubetsu Jounin, or Tokujou for short, these are Chuunins who have reached Jounin-level proficiency in a specific area or skill. They are specialists in their fields and are often assigned as subordinates to Jounins when their expertise is needed.

- **ANBU (CL 10 or higher)**: Short for Ansatsu Senjutsu Tokushu Butai (Special Assassination Tactical Squad). Members of this squad are covert operatives under the direct command of the Kage (village leader), highly skilled, wearing distinctive uniforms and masks. They often use codenames to protect their true identities. The ANBU do not follow the standard rank hierarchy (though their members are at least as skilled as Special Jounins, even if young). There is only a distinction between regular members and captains, who are exceptionally skilled and talented. All ANBU missions involve high risk, such as infiltrating enemy territory, assassinations, and protecting the Kage’s safety.

- **Jounins (CL 12)**: Chuunins or Special Jounins with extraordinary intelligence and strength are promoted to Jounins. This is a very high ninja level, and all Jounins are sent on the most difficult missions, typically involving assassinations and infiltrations, such as A-rank and S-rank missions. Additionally, Jounins are mature enough to train groups of three Genins and accompany them on missions.

- **Elite Jounins (CL 16)**: While not an official rank, this is a classification given to Jounins of immeasurable strength and some completely unknown abilities. Elite Jounins are commonly sent alone on S-rank missions and serve as primary commanders during wartime, second only to the Kage.

- **Sannins (CL 18)**: The Sannin title is also not a military rank. They are strong candidates for the position of Kage, considered "Legendary Ninjas" who often choose to wander the world for personal reasons but are not considered Rogue Ninjas, as they maintain contact with their respective villages. They possess immense power and great wisdom. A Sannin’s strength is often compared to that of a Kage.

- **Kage (CL 20)**: The leader and most powerful shinobi of a village. Their power can only be compared to that of another Kage (from a different village). Their role is to govern the entire village, including its shinobi, missions, and residents. In times of war, if necessary, a Kage is willing to give their life for their village.
