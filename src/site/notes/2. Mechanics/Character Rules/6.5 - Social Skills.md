Every character has two social Attributes: **Charisma** and **Manipulation**.

The player has a number of points to distribute between these Attributes equal to twice the minimum Attribute level.  
For example:

- A Special Jounin (with a minimum Attribute level of 3) has 2 × 3 = 6 points to distribute.
- A Genin (with a minimum Attribute level of 0) has 2 points for social Attributes.

The maximum level for social Attributes is the campaign’s power level limit.

With the Game Master’s permission, these points can be redistributed during the campaign to reflect changes in the character’s personality. Players may also choose not to allocate some or all of these points if the character has little to no social talent.

# Social Checks

All social checks follow this rule: Add your Charisma or Manipulation level to half the required Attribute or Skill (rounded up). The result is your accuracy for the social check.

For example, an Acting check has an accuracy equal to Charisma + ½ Art.
