**Heroic deeds are rewarded.** More than that, acts of daring, overcoming challenges, and adventures in general make someone more experienced, powerful, confident, and skilled (just like in the real world). In campaigns, heroes often start by fleeing from minions and weak enemies, only to end up facing great villains and thwarting their plans for domination!

**EVOLUTION TABLE**  
As a guide, the Evolution Table correlates the Campaign Level with the shinobi level, Attribute points, Skill points, and Power points. Note that for each Campaign Level, the character sheet points increase as follows: +5 to Attributes, +4 to Skills, and +2 to Powers. The exception is the Kage level, which has additional Power points.
