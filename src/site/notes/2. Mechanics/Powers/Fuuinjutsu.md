### STORAGE SEALS

#### LEVEL 1: STORAGE SEAL

- **Action**: 1 round (to seal)
- **Range**: Touch
- **Target**: Objects or techniques
- **Duration**: Permanent
- **Chakra Cost**: See text

This basic Fuuinjutsu technique allows sealing objects or jutsu in a **Jutsu Scroll** (10 Ryos, 1 item slot per scroll). You can seal:

- Up to **3 item slots** of objects.
- Jutsu with up to **3 chakra points** (normal or elemental).
- **1 small or smaller object** per item slot.

Scrolls cannot be sealed inside other scrolls, and used scrolls cannot be reused. Sealing or retrieving objects costs **1 chakra per item slot**. Sealing a jutsu costs **1 chakra** plus the jutsu’s chakra cost; releasing it requires paying the jutsu’s chakra cost again.

You can seal jutsu you or an ally know, or **continuous/permanent** jutsu already active in the environment (using the caster’s parameters). Jutsu with **personal or touch range**, or those requiring **sustained/concentration** duration, cannot be sealed.

In combat, releasing a scroll’s contents requires the same action as using the sealed item (e.g., **partial action** for a weapon, **standard action** for an attack jutsu). Only **1 item slot or 1 jutsu** can be released per action. Releasing objects/weapons requires no hand seals; releasing jutsu always requires hand seals, even if the original jutsu does not.

To release a ranged attack jutsu (from Ninpou or elemental powers), make a **Ranged Combat (CD)** test against the target’s defense, using the sealed jutsu’s parameters. **Hijutsu** (e.g., Mokuton) can be sealed, but only those with the same Hijutsu can use them.

Any character can unseal objects/weapons, but only those with sufficient **Character Level (NC)** can use sealed jutsu. **Kage Bunshin** and **Moku Bunshin** can release objects/weapons, but releasing jutsu requires the **True Clone** aptitude.

#### LEVEL 2: GREATER STORAGE SEAL

- **Action**: See text
- **Range**: Touch
- **Target**: Objects or techniques
- **Duration**: Permanent
- **Chakra Cost**: See text

Functions as **Storage Seal** but increases capacity to **6 item slots** or **1 chakra + 1 per power level**.

- At **level 3**, you can seal **1 medium-sized object** (uses all slots).
- At **level 5**, you can seal **1 large-sized object**.

Other rules remain unchanged.

### ADVANCED SEALS

Advanced seals require a **special blank tag** (same cost and space as explosive tags, 10 Ryos). Creating a seal costs chakra equal to the power level used and requires a **full action**. Seals are typically prepared in advance, consumed upon use, and cannot be reused. They are destroyed by **slashing or fire damage** and can only be used by their creator.

#### LEVEL 3: MISSHI (MESSENGER)

- **Action**: Standard
- **Duration**: Permanent (until message playback)
- **Chakra Cost**: 3

You record a message of up to **20 words** in the seal, spoken in your voice and language. You designate a specific **chakra signature** to trigger the seal. When a creature with that signature touches it, the message plays, and the seal self-destructs. You are instantly aware when the message is played.

#### LEVEL 4: BAKUDAN (BOMB)

- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Touch
- **Duration**: Permanent
- **Chakra Cost**: 1 per tag (creation); 1/2 power level (activation)

You create customized explosive tags with greater area and damage than standard tags. The explosion forms a **sphere** with a **2m diameter per power level** and deals **2 damage per power level**. Remote activation tests have a difficulty of **9 + 2x power level**. Only **1 Bakudan seal** can be used per attack.

Unlike standard explosive tags, additional tags don’t increase damage or difficulty, but **meta-aptitudes** (e.g., Potentiate) can be applied by spending a **movement action** when the seal explodes. Bakudan seals can be used as traps per the **Mechanisms** skill, subject to trap damage limits.

#### LEVEL 5: GENSOU NO IN (ILLUSION SEAL)

- **Action**: Standard
- **Area of Effect**: See text
- **Duration**: Permanent
- **Chakra Cost**: 5

You create an illusion of objects or creatures at the seal’s location, with dimensions up to **1m per Intelligence level**. Interaction is required to recognize the illusion, which cannot be dispelled by **Kai** (as it’s a ninjutsu). The illusion vanishes if the seal is removed or destroyed.

#### LEVEL 6: NINJUTSU NO WANA (NINJUTSU TRAP)

- **Prerequisite**: Mechanisms 10
- **Action**: 1 round (creation)
- **Area of Effect**: Circle, 0.5m diameter per Intelligence level
- **Duration**: Permanent (until triggered)
- **Chakra Cost**: 4 + ninjutsu chakra cost

You create a fixed trap that triggers a pre-selected ninjutsu from your arsenal (max level 8, if your NC allows) with a **ranged** effect. **Restricted powers** cannot be used. During creation, make a **CD** test as if using the ninjutsu; the result is recorded for the victim’s defense.

The first creature moving through the area triggers the ninjutsu, facing it with **-1 accuracy** on the stored test. If the ninjutsu has an area of effect, it becomes a **cone** originating from the seal. The trap cannot be disarmed unless you dispel it or it’s forcibly triggered.

**Search** or **Alertness** tests to detect the trap have a difficulty of **7 + 2x power level**, and only creatures with **Occultism** or **Fuuinjutsu** can attempt them.

#### LEVEL 7: CHAKRA NO SOUIN (CHAKRA CONTAINMENT SEAL)

- **Prerequisite**: Fuuinjutsu 7
- **Action**: Full
- **Area of Effect**: Circle, 1m diameter per Intelligence level
- **Duration**: Permanent
- **Chakra Cost**: See text

You create a chakra-absorbing seal that cannot be placed on moving objects or moved after creation. Activating it reduces your chakra to **1 point** (you must have at least **15 chakra**, including any shared with Kage Bunshin). The seal appears as a dark red archaic symbol covering the area.

Creatures in the area (whether touching it or not) lose **2 chakra per turn**, except those with your chakra signature. Chakra cannot drop below **1 point**.

#### LEVEL 8: KEKKAI NO IN (BARRIER SEAL)

- **Action**: Full
- **Area of Effect**: Walls, 0.5m height and width per Intelligence level
- **Duration**: Permanent
- **Chakra Cost**: 8

You create an invisible, indestructible chakra wall (1cm thick, square-shaped) with the seal at a corner or center (your choice). It cannot be moved, damaged, or altered, prevents creatures/objects from passing through, and provides defensive cover (but does not hide you, as it’s invisible). It does not block **space-time techniques** (e.g., Hiraishin) or **doujutsu**. The barrier ends if the seal is moved, removed, or destroyed.

### EPIC SEALS

Epic seals are the most powerful sealing techniques (Rank A to S, levels 8–10), often classified as **Kinjutsu** or highly secretive. Game Masters should carefully consider allowing player characters to use them.

#### LEVEL 8: SHISHOU FUUIN (FOUR SYMBOLS SEAL)

- **Prerequisite**: Occultism 16
- **Action**: 3 days
- **Range**: 20m
- **Target**: 1 Bijuu
- **Duration**: Permanent
- **Chakra Cost**: 16

This generic technique seals a **Bijuu** into a person or a special object (e.g., a pot). It varies by village (e.g., **Tekkou Fuuin** in the Cloud, **Hakke no Fuuin Shiki** in Konoha). The ritual requires **no tests** but extensive preparation and at least **10 people**, one of whom must know this technique. The Bijuu is typically restrained by genjutsu or lesser seals during the process.

After **3 days**, the Bijuu is sealed in a special pot (lasting up to **10 years**) or a person, who becomes a **Jinchuuriki** and can purchase/evolve the Jinchuuriki Hijutsu. Any disturbance cancels the ritual, requiring a restart. This technique can be performed instantly after **Shiki Fuujin**.

#### LEVEL 9: KEIYAKU FUUIN (ANTI-CONTRACT SEAL)

- **Prerequisite**: Occultism 16
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Touch
- **Target**: 1 creature
- **Duration**: Permanent
- **Chakra Cost**: 8

This technique targets a **Mangekyou Sharingan** user controlling a Bijuu via **Sharingan Hypnosis**. Touching the target (requires a touch test) instantly cancels their control over the Bijuu. No additional tests are needed.

#### LEVEL 10: SHIKI FUUJIN (DEAD DEMON SEALING)

- **Prerequisite**: Occultism 20
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Long (75m)
- **Target**: 1 creature
- **Duration**: Permanent
- **Chakra Cost**: 10

Developed by the **Uzumaki Clan**, this technique summons the **Shinigami** (Death God) to seal the target’s soul and the user’s soul, killing both.

**Execution**: After performing hand seals, the user’s soul partially separates, appearing behind them with the Shinigami (visible only to the user).

**Preparation**: The Shinigami wraps its left arm with prayer beads and chants incomprehensible words for **1 turn**. The user can act and defend freely during this time, and damage does not cancel the technique.

**Attack**: On the next turn, the Shinigami’s arms extend through the user’s abdomen, allowing the user to project them to **grab the target’s soul** (automatic success, as the Shinigami is invisible). The target becomes **helpless**, unable to move or use techniques except active ones requiring only a **free action**.

**Sealing**: The target’s soul is gradually extracted until the user’s next turn, when the target sees the Shinigami. The soul is then fully sealed in the user’s body, killing the target. If attacked during sealing, the user must pass a **Concentration** test (difficulty set by the GM based on damage). Failure extends the sealing by **1 turn**.

**Partial Sealing**: The user can seal only part of the soul (e.g., arms or legs) with a **partial action**, completing it immediately. This permanently disables the sealed limbs and leaves the target **exhausted**. No medical treatment can cure this, though **Medicine 16** and **Occultism 16** can create drugs to temporarily (1 day) negate exhaustion.

**Multiple Targets**: Using **Kage Bunshin** (with **True Clone**) beforehand allows sealing **1 additional target per clone** (max 2 extra). If clones are destroyed before completion, their targets are unaffected.

**Bijuu Sealing**: You can seal a Bijuu in yourself (taken to the Shinigami’s stomach) or another person, who becomes a **Jinchuuriki**.

**Conclusion**: After sealing, a mark appears on the user’s stomach. They survive for **5 minutes** before the Shinigami consumes both souls, killing the user. Sealed souls are trapped in the Shinigami’s stomach, fighting eternally, and cannot be revived by any means.
