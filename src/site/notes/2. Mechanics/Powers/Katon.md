The **Katon** (Fire Release) power enables a shinobi to manipulate fire. At lower levels, users can create sparks or small flames from their fingers. At the highest level, they become a god of fiery destruction, capable of vaporizing or reducing anything in their path to ashes. Katon is renowned for its large-scale destructive techniques, making high-level users feared across entire nations.

**Katon** follows the same rules as the **Ninpou** power but has limited access to effects due to fire’s immaterial nature (e.g., it cannot use **Shackle** to create prisons). However, Katon boasts the **largest area of effect** among all elements and shares the highest damage potential with **Fuuton**.

- **Range**: Medium (10m + 2m per Spirit level). You can only manipulate or create fire up to the power’s maximum range.
- **Size**: Creations, manipulations, and areas of effect can have up to **2m of diameter, length, width, or height per Spirit level**.
- **Additional Damage**: All Katon effects gain **+2 base damage**.
- **Allowed Effects**: Cannon, Orb, Arrows, Column, Destructive Breath, Ray, Energize, Missile, Explosive Wave, Ricochet.
- **Exclusive Effects**: Listed below.

### EXCLUSIVE KATON EFFECTS

#### LEVEL 5 EFFECT

**FLAMMABLE**

- **Action**: Movement
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Area of Effect**: Circle with standard diameter for the power
- **Damage**: Bonus (see text)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Chakra Cost**: 3 + chakra cost of the combustion effect

You create a flammable liquid, mist, or gas that spreads in a circular area with the power’s standard diameter. This effect deals no damage on its own but enhances the damage of any **Katon** or **Raiton** technique used afterward.

With a **standard action**, you can use the **Cannon** effect from **Katon** or **Raiton** to create a spark, triggering an instantaneous combustion or explosion. The explosion covers the Flammable effect’s area, deals **fire-type damage**, and uses the **Cannon** effect’s damage value plus a **+2 bonus**. **Meta-feats** cannot be used with Flammable.

**Evolutions**:

- **Flammable Level 8**: You can use any **Katon** or **Raiton** effect with **instantaneous duration** and standard range to trigger the combustion, retaining the effect’s properties and rules.

#### LEVEL 9 EFFECT

**METEORS**

- **Action**: Full
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Area of Effect**: Six spheres, each 5m in diameter
- **Damage**: See text
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

You create **six meteors** that fly to a chosen point and explode on impact. Each meteor deals **1 fixed damage per power level used** (no base damage or additional bonuses). A creature caught in the explosion of multiple meteors takes damage from each.

You can target specific creatures with a **-3 accuracy penalty** on your attack test. If targeted, victims cannot use **Dodge** or the **Anticipate** maneuver for defense.
