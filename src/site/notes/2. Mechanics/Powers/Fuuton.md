The **Fuuton** (Wind Release) power grants a shinobi the ability to manipulate air, the most vital and abundant element in any environment. At its basic level, users can control small amounts of air to create breezes, air pockets, or gusts. At higher levels, they become akin to gods of wind manipulation, capable of devastating forests with hurricane-like force.

**Fuuton** is an offensive-focused ninjutsu style, excelling in techniques that deal direct damage or enhance weapon damage, particularly for slashing and piercing weapons. It shares the highest damage potential among elements alongside **Katon**.

**Fuuton** follows the same rules as the **Ninpou** power but has limited access to effects due to the immaterial nature of wind (e.g., it cannot use **Shackle** to create prisons).

- **Range**: Medium (10m + 2m per Spirit level). You can only manipulate or create wind up to the power’s maximum range.
- **Size**: Creations, manipulations, and areas of effect can have up to **1m of diameter, length, width, or height per Spirit level**.
- **Additional Damage**: All Fuuton effects gain **+2 base damage**.
- **Allowed Effects**: Cannon, Orb, Barrier, Column, Arrows, Destructive Breath, Ray, Cloud, Energize, Missile, Explosive Wave, Ricochet, Torrent, Flammable (Katon-specific effect).
- **Exclusive Effects**: Listed below.

### EXCLUSIVE FUUTON EFFECTS

#### LEVEL 5 EFFECT

**POISONOUS**

- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Area of Effect**: Cone, standard size for the power
- **Damage**: None
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

You create a poisonous mist or smoke using a poison crafted with the **Poisoncraft** skill (up to **level II** poisons). The technique deals no damage but injects the poison into the target’s body, requiring appropriate resistance tests. The poison used is consumed.

#### LEVEL 6 EFFECT

**SHARPEN**

- **Prerequisite**: Energize
- **Action**: Partial
- **Range**: Personal
- **Target**: One slashing or piercing weapon
- **Damage**: See text
- **Duration**: Sustained
- **Hand Seals**: No

This technique enhances a real slashing or piercing weapon (not natural weapons or those created by **Create Weapon**), granting all **Energize** benefits plus the following:

- **Improved Edge**: The weapon ignores **1 point of target hardness**. Any normal weapon blocking or blocked by a Sharpened weapon is destroyed unless under the **Energize** effect (except **Energize Raiton**), in which case your attack is an **automatic success**.
- **Improved Critical**: The weapon’s critical range increases by **1** (e.g., 15–16 becomes 14–15–16). This does not stack with other critical range bonuses.
- **Extended Blade**: You create a chakra blade extending up to **30cm** from the weapon, controlled at will. This doesn’t increase melee range but complicates enemy defense. Make a resisted **Spirit vs. Alertness** test when attacking. If successful, the target takes a **-1 penalty** to **Dodge**, **Anticipate**, and **Block** reactions.
- **Extended Shuriken**: Applies to simple shuriken. One use extends the blades of up to **three shuriken**, changing their combined base damage to the **power’s standard damage**.

#### LEVEL 7 EFFECT

**WIND BLADE**

- **Prerequisite**: Energize
- **Action**: Full
- **Range**: 5m
- **Target**: One creature
- **Damage**: See text
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Hand Seals**: No

You emit chakra from your fingertips, creating near-invisible, high-speed spinning wind blades and hurl them at the target. The blades dissipate immediately after hitting. You create and throw **1 blade per power level**, each dealing **1 base damage** (total **3 damage per blade** with Fuuton’s +2 bonus). Only the elemental bonus applies; no other damage bonuses are added.

Make one **attack test** for all blades; the target makes one defense. Before defending, the target must pass an **Alertness** test to see the attack. Failure means they are **feinted**. Creatures with **chakra vision** or **Kagura Shingan** automatically succeed. Other chakra sensors must test with **-2 difficulty**.

**Evolutions**:

- **Wind Blade Level 10**: A target failing the Alertness test is **flat-footed**.
