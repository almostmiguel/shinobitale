The **Suiton** (Water Release) power allows a shinobi to conjure and control water at will, shaping it into any desired form or moving it effortlessly. At higher levels, users can create massive tsunamis capable of altering natural landscapes.

**Suiton** follows the same rules as the **Ninpou** power and can use all its effects. It has the same range and size as Ninpou and is the **second most versatile element**, surpassed only by **Doton**.

- **Range**: Medium (10m + 2m per Spirit level). You can only manipulate or create water up to the power’s maximum range.
- **Size**: Creations, manipulations, and areas of effect can have up to **1m of diameter, length, width, or height per Spirit level**.
- **Allowed Effects**: All Ninpou effects, Flammable (Katon), Poisonous (Fuuton), Immerge (Doton).
- **Exclusive Effects**: Listed below, plus the Hoshigaki Clan’s **Shark Prison**.

### EXCLUSIVE SUITON EFFECTS

#### LEVEL 2 EFFECT

**MIST**

- **Prerequisite**: Blind Fighting aptitude or a sensor ability
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: 1m
- **Target**: Environment
- **Area of Effect**: Circle, 30m diameter + 3m per Spirit level, with standard power height
- **Duration**: Sustained

You create a fog from a chosen origin point. Only creatures within **1m** are clearly visible; those beyond have **partial camouflage** (attacks have a **25% miss chance**; see Camouflage and Cover).

The mist has an **imaginary hardness** equal to the power’s standard hardness. Area attacks with explosions (e.g., Katon) or winds (e.g., Fuuton) reduce its hardness. If reduced to zero, the mist dissipates. Imaginary hardness follows object hardness rules but does not reduce attack damage.

Mist has **no elemental disadvantage** against Doton but is **disadvantaged against Fuuton**.

**Optional Rule**: With the Game Master’s permission, this effect can be purchased for **Ninpou** but not other elemental powers, and it cannot evolve.

**Evolutions**:

- **Mist Level 5**: Creatures within 1m have **partial camouflage**, and those beyond have **total camouflage** (50% miss chance, and attackers cannot use vision to locate them).

#### LEVEL 3 EFFECT

**WATER PRISON**

- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: 1m
- **Target**: One creature (see text)
- **Damage**: None
- **Duration**: Concentration

You conjure a dome of flowing water to trap a target, requiring a **Ranged Combat (CD)** test at 1m range (with a **-3 accuracy penalty** for proximity or a **Concentration** test for close combat). You must maintain contact with the prison to sustain it.

The dome’s thickness and chakra density render the target **paralyzed**, but the inner space is water-free, allowing normal breathing and speech. The prison has **half the standard power hardness**. You can reuse the technique to restore lost hardness (spending chakra and the action again, without re-rolling the attack test).

The effect can target multiple creatures if used via **Water Clones** (1 target per clone). Using a **Mizu Bunshin** avoids the close-combat penalty if far enough from the target, but the original user must maintain **concentration** (see Mizu Bunshin).

A paralyzed target can use a **standard action** to make a **Strength** test (standard difficulty) or **Vigor** test (standard difficulty -2) to regain mobility for the scene, allowing them to attack the prison from within to destroy it. If a **coup de grâce** is attempted, the prison absorbs the attack and dissipates, with any excess damage affecting the target (automatic success, roll 2 dice for damage degree). Special defenses (e.g., **Kamui** intangibility) still apply.

This effect cannot be used with **meta-aptitudes**.

**Evolutions**:

- **Water Prison Level 9**: The prison becomes **suffocating**, filled with water, causing the target to suffer **suffocation** (tests at standard difficulty -2). When used via a **Mizu Bunshin**, the duration becomes **sustained**.

#### LEVEL 6 EFFECT

**WAVE COLLISION**

- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Area of Effect**: Wave, standard size for the power
- **Damage**: See text
- **Duration**: Concentration

You conjure a large volume of water that surges violently over an area, dealing **10 base damage**. Structures (e.g., houses, buildings) take **double damage**.

The technique can be sustained by **concentration**, costing **half the chakra** each turn. Targets failing their defensive action are swept up by the waves and must pass an **Athletics (Swimming)** test (standard difficulty) with a **movement action** to reach the surface, or they suffer **suffocation** (fixed damage equal to the effect’s base damage). Submerged targets cannot be targeted by other physical attacks.

Alternatively, a target can use a **standard action** to swim to the surface without a test or hold their breath with a **Vigor** test (standard difficulty -2; see Suffocation).

While concentrating, you can continue attacking to trap additional targets (requiring a new attack test) and freely move the wave’s area within the power’s range. Submerged targets are unaffected by further attacks from this effect.

**Evolutions**:

- **Wave Collision Level 8**: Base damage increases to **14**.
- **Wave Collision Level 10**: Base damage increases to **18**, and targets can no longer use a **standard action** to swim without tests.
