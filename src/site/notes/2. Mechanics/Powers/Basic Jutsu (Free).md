These are the fundamental jutsu every **genin** learns upon graduating from the ninja academy. As basic techniques, they are **free** for all characters.

#### BUNSHIN NO JUTSU (CLONE TECHNIQUE)

- **Ninjutsu Rank**: E
- **Action**: Movement or Standard (see text)
- **Range**: Personal
- **Duration**: Sustained
- **Chakra Cost**: 1 or 4 (see text)

Creates **one or two illusory clones** of the user, costing **1 chakra** regardless of the number of clones. These clones are mere images, unable to use jutsu, maneuvers, or deal damage. They disappear when touched by any creature or object. Clones have all combat actions but act on the user’s turn with no separate initiative.

You can use Bunshin no Jutsu to **feint**, confusing the enemy or faking attacks. This requires a **standard action** and **4 chakra**, with a **Sleight of Hand vs. Notice** test. Success leaves the opponent **feinted** against your next melee or projectile attack. Clones used this way cannot perform other actions and vanish after your attack.

#### HENGE NO JUTSU (TRANSFORMATION TECHNIQUE)

- **Ninjutsu Rank**: E
- **Action**: Movement
- **Range**: Personal
- **Duration**: Sustained
- **Chakra Cost**: 1

Allows the user to transform into another person, animal, or object of the same size category, altering their appearance. No test is required to use Henge. However, anyone interacting with the transformed user can make a **Perception** test (difficulty 7 + user’s Disguise skill level) to notice flaws and identify the transformation.

Henge can conceal minor details (e.g., scars, hair color) but is instantly canceled when using another technique.

#### KAI (RELEASE)

- **Ninjutsu Rank**: D
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Touch
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Chakra Cost**: Equal to the canceled Genjutsu’s cost
- **Hand Seals**: No

Allows the user to free themselves or another from a **Genjutsu**. The user makes a **Spirit or Intelligence** test against the Genjutsu’s resistance difficulty (without reductions from repeated **Notice Genjutsu** tests). The chakra cost equals the Genjutsu’s chakra cost.

When used on yourself, no test or chakra cost is required, but you must have succeeded on a **Notice Genjutsu** test (p. 233). Kai can be used even if you’re **paralyzed**, **helpless**, or under restricted actions due to the Genjutsu. You can also cancel your own Genjutsu without a test or chakra cost.

#### KAWARIMI NO JUTSU (BODY REPLACEMENT TECHNIQUE)

- **Ninjutsu Rank**: E
- **Type**: Shunjutsu
- **Action**: Movement
- **Range**: Personal
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Chakra Cost**: 1
- **Hand Seals**: Optional

Allows the user to swap places with a nearby object of similar size (or materials like leaves, dirt, stones, or sand if no object is available). When used during an enemy attack, it creates an optical illusion, making the attack seem successful. This allows the user to exploit the distraction for a more effective attack or to escape.

**Once per scene**, you can use Kawarimi as a **defensive action**, spending **1 chakra** to completely avoid an attack without tests (for either attacker or defender). You move up to your full movement distance, and this movement does not provoke **opportunistic attacks**.

Kawarimi works against **projectiles**, **normal attacks**, or melee/projectile techniques (e.g., Cannon, Arrows, Lightning Blade, Rasengan) but not against **area attacks**. It cannot be used if you’re **flat-footed**, **feinted**, or under movement restrictions (e.g., grappled, immobilized).

If successful, you can attempt a **Stealth vs. Notice** test to hide within your movement range (halved per Stealth rules, p. 41), requiring a **standard action** and available cover/camouflage.

#### KINOBORI (TREE CLIMBING TECHNIQUE)

- **Ninjutsu Rank**: E
- **Type**: Chakra Control
- **Action**: Free
- **Range**: Personal
- **Duration**: Continuous
- **Chakra Cost**: 1
- **Hand Seals**: No

By focusing chakra in your feet, you can adhere to any surface, allowing you to walk on walls, climb trees, or move upside-down on ceilings. The effect lasts for the entire scene with **1 chakra**. No tests are needed unless something disrupts your balance or concentration, requiring an **Athletics** (to grab something) or **Acrobatics** (to regain balance) test, depending on the situation.

#### SHUNSHIN NO JUTSU (BODY FLICKER TECHNIQUE)

- **Ninjutsu Rank**: D
- **Type**: Shunjutsu
- **Action**: Movement
- **Range**: Personal
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Chakra Cost**: 1

This technique allows super-fast movement, appearing as teleportation to non-ninjas. You infuse your body with chakra to move at high speed, up to your **maximum movement distance**, with **1 chakra**. Visual effects (e.g., leaves, smoke, sand) can enhance the technique for flair but provide no combat advantage, as other ninjas can track the movement.

#### TADAYOU (WATER SURFACE WALKING TECHNIQUE)

- **Ninjutsu Rank**: D
- **Type**: Chakra Control
- **Action**: Free
- **Range**: Personal
- **Duration**: Continuous
- **Chakra Cost**: 1
- **Hand Seals**: No

Allows the user to walk on water or any non-flammable, non-acidic liquid. Tests use the **Spirit** attribute but are only required if something disrupts balance or concentration (e.g., turbulent conditions).
