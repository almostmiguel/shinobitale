The **Doton** (Earth Release) power allows a shinobi to manipulate earth in its raw form (e.g., stones) or refined form (e.g., soil). It is a combat style effective at short to medium range, primarily used for defensive techniques and effects that don’t focus on dealing damage as their main goal.

**Doton** follows the same rules as the **Ninpou** power and can use all its effects. However, Doton techniques have a **shorter range** compared to other elemental powers.

- **Range**: Short (5m + 1m per Spirit level). You can only manipulate or create earth up to the power’s maximum range.
- **Size**: Large Scale (1m per Spirit level). Creations, manipulations, and areas of effect can have up to 1m of diameter, length, width, or height per Spirit level.
- **Additional Hardness**: All Doton creations (e.g., barriers) gain **+2 hardness**.
- **Allowed Effects**: All Ninpou effects plus the exclusive Doton effects listed below.

### EXCLUSIVE DOTON EFFECTS

#### LEVEL 2 EFFECTS

**IMMERGE**

- **Action**: Full
- **Range**: Personal
- **Duration**: Continuous

You can merge with or fully submerge into your element (e.g., natural ground or cave walls) or objects created via **Free Creation** or the **Barrier** effect. The immersion site must be large enough to accommodate your body.

While immersed, you gain the **Expert** feat’s benefits for **Stealth**, cannot move, and have vision limited to **10m**. Stealth bonuses persist while hidden unless something reveals your position. Attacking or using techniques (unless they don’t originate from you) reveals your location. Exiting immersion is a **movement action**.

You remain just centimeters below the surface, and the element’s hardness does not protect against enemy attacks.

**False Decapitation**: While immersed in the ground and successful in a **Stealth** test, you can use the **Grapple** maneuver as a **stealth attack** against a target directly above you. As a **full action**, you pull the target into the ground and leap out, leaving them with only their head above ground, under the **immobilized** condition. Escaping requires a **movement action** and a successful **Strength** or **Escape** test (Difficulty 10).

**Evolutions**:

- **Immerge Level 4**: You can move at **half your normal speed** within the medium while maintaining stealth, and your senses are unimpeded.

**TREMOR**

- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Area of Effect**: Circle, 2m diameter
- **Damage**: None
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

You send chakra through the ground to a target area within range, causing it to tremble. Creatures in the area can make a defensive action; if they fail, they are **knocked prone**. Alternatively, they can spend a **movement action** to make an immediate **Acrobatics** test to remain standing.

**Evolutions**:

- **Tremor Level 4**: The circle’s diameter becomes the **standard size** for the power.

#### LEVEL 6 EFFECT

**STONE SKIN**

- **Action**: Movement
- **Range**: Personal
- **Duration**: Instantaneous or Sustained
- **Hand Seals**: No

You harden your skin to match the toughest minerals, gaining **body hardness** equal to the power’s **standard hardness +2** (from Doton’s bonus) until the end of the turn.

You can sustain the effect, but **sustained body hardness** is reduced to **1** (no elemental bonus). Hardness is not cumulative; only the highest applies, even from the same source.

**Defense**: You can use Stone Skin as a defensive technique with a **Read Movement (LM)** test, even while sustaining it, requiring a **movement action**.

**Stone Punch**: You can use and sustain the **Energize - Doton** effect alongside Stone Skin as a **free action**. Your punches deal **lethal damage** with **4 weapon damage**.

**Evolutions**:

- **Stone Skin Level 9**: Sustained body hardness increases to **2**. The **Stone Punch** cannot be blocked with the **Block** reaction.
