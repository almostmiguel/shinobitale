**Prerequisites**: [[2. Mechanics/Feats/General Feats/Medical Ninja\|Medical Ninja]] feat, Spirit 6  
**Range**: Touch  
**Action**: Standard  
**Duration**: Concentration  
**Type**: Ninjutsu  
**Subtype**: Chakra Control  
**Hand Seals**: No

**Iryou Ninjutsu** allows a shinobi to channel precise chakra through their hands to accelerate cell regeneration in a patient, greatly enhancing wound healing.

To use the healing technique, spend chakra equal to the **power level used** and a **standard action** with full concentration. Both the user and patient must remain immobile during treatment. At the end of each turn, the patient recovers **Vitality points** equal to the **power level + 1/2 Medicine skill level** (rounded up). Add **+1 Vitality** if you have the **Expert: Medicine** feat and an additional **+1** if you have the **Innate Skill: Medicine** feat.

Conditions like **bleeding** or tissues cut by **Chakra Scalpel** are fully healed in the first turn of treatment. Healing yourself requires double the effort, halving the Vitality recovered, but this limitation is overcome at **power level 4** or higher.

### CHAKRA NO MESU (CHAKRA SCALPEL)

- **Ninjutsu Rank**: B
- **Subtype**: Chakra Control
- **Prerequisites**: Iryou Ninjutsu level 6
- **Action**: Movement
- **Range**: Personal
- **Duration**: Sustained

You refine chakra manipulation to create two **extremely sharp chakra blades** in your hands, used as surgical scalpels. Unlike regular scalpels, these can cut inside the body without open wounds, reducing infection risks.

In combat, the scalpel can be used offensively to cut muscles and tendons, impairing mobility. Attacks are **touch-based**, deal **lethal damage** equal to **2 per power level used**, and can be used with **Multiple Attack** (dividing damage per normal rules). **Unarmed Block** reactions cannot be used against it.

If a target is hit **three times**, they must pass a **Stamina test** (difficulty 7 + power level + 1/2 Medicine skill level). Failure results in **slowed** and **debilitated** conditions with cut muscle tissues, lasting **2 months**. These conditions can be healed with **1 turn of Iryou Ninjutsu** or **1 month of rest**.

### IN’YU SHOMETSU (SECRET WOUND RECOVERY)

- **Ninjutsu Rank**: A
- **Subtype**: Chakra Control
- **Prerequisites**: Iryou Ninjutsu level 6, Expert and Innate Skill for Medicine
- **Action**: Movement
- **Range**: Personal
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Hand Seals**: No
- **Chakra Cost**: 1 per 2 Vitality healed

This defensive technique allows you to anticipate an attack and begin **cellular regeneration** to minimize damage. You instantly use **Iryou Ninjutsu** on yourself, healing up to the **damage received** from a single attack. No tests are required, but it cannot be used against **critical hits** or **area attacks**.

Due to the strain of instant regeneration, this technique is limited to **once per day**.

### SHOUSEN NO JUTSU (MYSTICAL PALM TECHNIQUE)

- **Ninjutsu Rank**: A
- **Subtype**: Chakra Control
- **Prerequisites**: Iryou Ninjutsu level 7
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Touch
- **Duration**: Concentration
- **Hand Seals**: No

By channeling chakra to a wound or affected area, this technique rapidly enhances healing at the **standard Iryou Ninjutsu rate**. The chakra amount must match the injury’s severity.

Offensively, you can send excessive chakra to disrupt the target’s chakra circulation, potentially knocking them out. The target must pass a **Stamina test** (difficulty 7 + power level + 1/2 Medicine skill level). Failure results in being **stunned** until the end of their next turn. A **critical failure** requires a second test; failing again renders them **unconscious**.
