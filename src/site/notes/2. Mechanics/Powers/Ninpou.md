The **Ninpou** power, along with elemental ninjutsu (e.g., Katon, Suiton), allows players to create or recreate techniques using a list of **effects**. These effects have generic names (e.g., Destructive Breath, Ray, Missile) rather than specific jutsu names from the anime. Players can name their techniques freely, either using anime names or creating original ones, as long as they follow the effect’s rules for damage, range, and other parameters.

**Free Creations**: You can create objects or effects not listed, such as a wall for defense, using the **Barrier** effect’s rules. Free creations have **half the standard parameters** (e.g., damage, hardness) of the power. **Solid** creations (e.g., stone, wood) have **continuous duration**, while others (e.g., water, air) are **sustained**.

**Purchasing Ninpou Multiple Times**: You can buy and advance the **Ninpou** power multiple times to gain additional effects. The first level of each additional purchase is **free**. The highest power level determines the parameters for all effects.  
_Example_:

- Ninpou level 4 (Cannon, Restraining, Barrier, Destructive Breath) costs **4 points**.
- A second Ninpou level 3 (Cannon, Ray, Arrows) costs **2 points** (level 1 is free).

### LIST OF NINPOU EFFECTS

Below is a detailed list of **Ninpou** effects, including their rules and availability for basic elemental powers (Katon, Suiton, Doton, Fuuton, Raiton). For **Kekkei Genkai** elements (e.g., Mokuton), see their specific descriptions for available effects.

---

#### LEVEL 1 EFFECT

**CANNON**

- **Available for**: Ninpou, all basic elements
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Target**: One creature
- **Damage**: 2 per power level
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

You fire a jet-like attack using your element (e.g., a water jet for Suiton, a fire projectile for Katon). The target takes **2 damage per power level** used.  
From **level 2**, you can use Cannon **without chakra cost**, but damage (including elemental bonuses) is **halved**, and no additional benefits (e.g., feats, combined effects) can be applied unless explicitly allowed.

---

#### LEVEL 2 EFFECTS

**CREATE WEAPON**

- **Available for**: Ninpou, Doton, Suiton
- **Action**: Partial
- **Range**: Personal
- **Damage**: See text
- **Duration**: Permanent (solid weapons), Sustained (non-solid weapons)
- **Chakra Cost**: 1 (creation)
- **Hand Seals**: No

You create a simple or martial weapon (light, long, medium, or thrown, excluding Kage Fushä, Straight Blade, or Giant Fan). The weapon deals damage as per its standard version and can be made for medium or smaller characters. One use fills an item slot with weapons or ammunition. You must meet the weapon’s attribute prerequisites and know how to use it to avoid penalties.

Solid weapons (e.g., Doton) are **permanent**; non-solid weapons (e.g., Suiton) are **sustained** and dissolve if they leave your hand. Created weapons inherit the element’s strengths and weaknesses, including **hardness** (but not elemental damage bonuses). For example, a Suiton whip struggles against Doton barriers but can deflect Katon projectiles.

Created weapons allow the **Block** reaction against projectile techniques (e.g., Cannon, Arrows) but can be blocked like normal weapons.

**Evolutions**:

- **Create Weapon Level 6**: You can create **heavy weapons** and weapons for characters larger than medium.

**ORB**

- **Available for**: Ninpou, all basic elements
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Target**: One creature
- **Damage**: Standard for the power
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

You create and fire a 0.5m-diameter spherical projectile, dealing **standard power damage**.

**Evolutions**:

- **Orb Level 7**: Costs **half chakra** but cannot benefit from other effects, technique feats, or powers.

**RAY**

- **Available for**: Ninpou, all basic elements
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Target**: One or more creatures (see text)
- **Damage**: 2 per power level
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

You strike with a ray that cannot be blocked (except by special weapons capable of blocking techniques). It deals **2 damage per power level**.

**Evolutions**:

- **Ray Level 5**: Fire one ray per 2 power levels, each targeting a different creature within **4m** of each other.
- **Ray Level 8**: With a **full action**, fire a single, more powerful ray at one target, dealing **+2 base damage**.

**RESTRAINING**

- **Available for**: Ninpou, Doton, Suiton
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Area of Effect**: Circle
- **Damage**: None
- **Duration**: Continuous

You create a sticky, thick layer on the ground that slows enemies. Creatures in the area are **slowed** unless they have the **Flight** skill. If a creature is already in the area, they get a defensive action. If successful, they must still exit the area on their next turn or face the penalties again.

Victims can use a **free action** to make an **Escape** or **Strength** test to negate the **slowed** condition until the end of their turn but must move out of the area to avoid reapplication. Area attacks targeting the Restraining area remove the effect, allowing victims to move freely during their defense against the attack.

**Evolutions**:

- **Restraining Level 6**: Victims are **immobilized** instead, unable to perform actions requiring foot mobility.

---

#### LEVEL 3 EFFECTS

**BARRIER**

- **Available for**: Ninpou, Doton, Fuuton, Suiton
- **Action**: Movement
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Duration**: Permanent (solid barriers), Sustained (other barriers)

You conjure a barrier (wall or semicylinder, half the power’s standard size) to protect against attacks. It has **standard hardness** and requires space between you and the enemy (no defense against adjacent enemies). Using it for defense requires a **Read Movement (LM)** test with **+2 accuracy**, with chakra paid before the test.

If destroyed, protected characters take the remaining damage after hardness reduction. Solid barriers (e.g., stone, wood) are **permanent**; others (e.g., water, wind) are **sustained**. Ice barriers have a **special permanent duration**, melting in **1 hour per power level**.

**Evolutions**:

- **Barrier Level 6**: Becomes a **hemispherical dome**, fully enclosing the user or trapping enemies (standard action, CD test -2).
- **Barrier Level 9**: **+2 hardness**.

**FLECHAS (ARROWS)**

- **Available for**: Ninpou, all basic elements
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Target**: One or more creatures
- **Damage**: 2 per projectile
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

You launch multiple projectiles (e.g., arrows, needles, shuriken, small fireballs), each dealing **2 base damage**. Create **1 projectile per power level**, targeting one or multiple creatures within range. Each target makes one defense regardless of projectile count. Damage bonuses (including elemental) apply only once per target.

**Feint**: For **2 chakra**, use Arrows as a **Feint** to mask your next ranged attack (any type). Use **Prestidigitation** instead of **Agility** for the Feint test. No damage is dealt in this mode.

**Evolutions**:

- **Arrows Level 6**: If targeting one creature and they succeed on **Dodge** or **Anticipate**, you can reroll the attack but deal **half base damage**. The target doesn’t reroll their defense.
- **Arrows Level 9**: Rerolled attacks deal **full damage**.

**Hardness Rule**: Hardness determines how much damage an object can take before breaking, checked before applying damage degree. For example, a **Barrier with hardness 7** hit by a **9-damage technique** breaks, with **2 damage** passing through at the attack’s damage degree. If damaged but not broken, hardness is reduced by **2 points**.

#### LEVEL 4 EFFECTS

**LANCE**

- **Available for**: Ninpou, Doton, Suiton
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Target**: One or more creatures
- **Damage**: Standard for the power
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

You create a sharp spike emerging up to **2m** away, stretching toward the enemy. It ignores **2 points of hardness** on barriers/objects. Create one lance for a single target or multiple lances for multiple targets, dividing the power’s base damage among them.

**Evolutions**:

- **Lance Level 6**: The lance emerges from below, ignoring pre-existing cover and negating defense bonuses for **prone** targets (must still be in range).
- **Lance Level 9**: Targets must pass a **Notice** test before defending; failure makes them **flat-footed**.

**RICOCHET**

- **Available for**: Ninpou, all basic elements
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Target**: One or more creatures (see text)
- **Damage**: Standard for the power + bonus (see text)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

You fire a ray that bounces between enemies, hitting up to **1 additional enemy per 2 power levels** within **10m** of the original target. The effect continues in your chosen order until a target successfully defends, stopping the effect.

**Evolutions**:

- **Ricochet Level 9**: Each new target hit increases base damage by **+1**, up to **+5**.

#### LEVEL 5 EFFECTS

**COLUMN**

- **Available for**: Ninpou, all basic elements
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Area of Effect**: Cylinder
- **Damage**: 2 per power level
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

You create a vertical cylindrical explosion with the power’s standard diameter and height. Targets in the area take **2 damage per power level**.

**Evolutions**:

- **Column Level 7**: Divide the cylinder into smaller **1m-diameter columns**, choosing which areas are affected (within the standard size).
- **Column Level 10**: Mini-columns surround targets from multiple directions. Targets failing an **Notice** test take a **-2 defense penalty**.

**ENERGIZE**

- **Available for**: Ninpou, all basic elements
- **Action**: Partial
- **Range**: Personal
- **Target**: Weapon or projectile compartment
- **Damage**: See text
- **Chakra Cost**: 3
- **Duration**: Sustained
- **Hand Seals**: No

You energize your fist, a held weapon, or a compartment of projectiles. When attacking, you can replace **Strength/Dexterity** with **Spirit** for damage calculations (optional). Energized weapons gain the element’s strengths and weaknesses but not damage or hardness bonuses.

With **Ambidexterity**, you can energize two weapons with one action, paying chakra for each. The effect ends if the weapon is sheathed or, for projectiles, at the end of your turn after being thrown. Energized weapons allow **Block** against projectile techniques (e.g., Cannon, Arrows) but can be blocked normally.

You can use Energize immediately after **Create Weapon** (same element) as a **free action**. It cannot be used with other melee-altering support techniques (e.g., **Juuken**, **Chakra Scalpel**). **Special weapons** (e.g., Adamantine Staff, p. 230) cannot be energized unless specified.

**NUVEM (CLOUD)**

- **Available for**: Ninpou, Doton, Fuuton, Suiton
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Target**: Environment
- **Area of Effect**: Circle with double the standard size
- **Damage**: See text
- **Duration**: Concentration

You create a hot, corrosive, or otherwise hazardous cloud, fired as a cone and settling as a circular area with **double the standard diameter**. It persists while you maintain **concentration**. At the start of your turn, living creatures in the cloud must pass a **Stamina test (standard difficulty -2)** or take **1 fixed damage per power level** and become **slowed** due to coughing or other adverse effects. You are unaffected. Creatures avoiding contact with the cloud for a turn avoid its effects.

The cloud has an **imaginary hardness** (standard for the power). Area attacks with explosions (e.g., Katon) or winds (e.g., Fuuton) reduce its hardness. If reduced to zero, the cloud dissipates. Imaginary hardness follows object hardness rules (p. 274) but doesn’t reduce attack damage.

**Evolutions**:

- **Cloud Level 7**: Duration becomes **sustained**.
- **Cloud Level 10**: **+3 hardness**, and fixed damage is **doubled**.

**SOPRO DESTRUTIVO (DESTRUCTIVE BREATH)**

- **Available for**: Ninpou, all basic elements
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Area of Effect**: Cone
- **Damage**: Standard for the power
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

You project a cone-shaped attack (e.g., a fiery breath for Katon), dealing **standard power damage** to all in the area.

**Evolutions**:

- **Sopro Level 7**: The attack spreads intensely, complicating defense. Even if a target succeeds on **Dodge** or **Anticipate**, they must pass an **Acrobatics** test or take the power’s damage with **degree 1** as residual damage. **Accelerated** enemies automatically pass this test.
- **Sopro Level 10**: Residual damage becomes **degree 2** if the attack’s damage degree was 2 or higher.

---

#### LEVEL 6 EFFECTS

**CORRENTEZA (TORRENT)**

- **Available for**: Ninpou, Doton, Fuuton, Suiton
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Area of Effect**: Wave
- **Damage**: Standard for the power
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

You conjure a wave of water, mud, wind, or another fluid, sweeping enemies in a wave shape starting in front of you. Targets must pass a **Stamina test (standard difficulty -2)** or be pushed to the effect’s maximum distance. Colliding with an obstacle capable of stopping movement adds **+1 concussion damage**.

**Evolutions**:

- **Torrent Level 8**: Targets failing the Stamina test and colliding with an obstacle are also **stunned** until the end of their next turn.

**MÍSSIL (MISSILE)**

- **Available for**: Ninpou, all basic elements
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Area of Effect**: Line
- **Damage**: Standard for the power + bonus (see text)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

You fire one or more missiles (e.g., mud dragon heads for Doton, sequential fire blasts for Katon), dealing **standard power damage**. After hitting, roll the attack test again (target doesn’t reroll defense). A successful reroll adds **+1 base damage**.

**Fire Dragon [Katon Missile Only]**: You can use Missile against a target bound by a **kousen** in the same turn for a **partial action**, destroying the kousen.

**Evolutions**:

- **Missile Level 8**: Reroll the attack test **twice**, gaining **+1 damage** per success.
- **Missile Level 10**: Reroll the attack test **four times**.

**ONDA EXPLOSIVA (EXPLOSIVE WAVE)**

- **Available for**: Ninpou, all basic elements
- **Action**: Standard
- **Area of Effect**: Hemisphere or circle with double the diameter
- **Damage**: Standard for the power
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

You project a shockwave around you (hemisphere or circle centered on you), taking forms like a fire explosion or water tornado. Targets take **standard power damage** and must pass a **Stamina test (standard difficulty -2)** or be pushed to the effect’s edge. Cannot be used with **Potentiate**.

**Evolutions**:

- **Explosive Wave Level 8**: Targets failing the Stamina test are also **knocked prone**.

**ALGEMAR (SHACKLE)**

- **Available for**: Ninpou, Doton, Suiton
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Standard for the power
- **Target**: One creature
- **Damage**: None
- **Duration**: Concentration

You bind one or both of the target’s legs with shackles, ropes, or structures made from your power’s material, rendering them **immobilized** without dealing damage. The victim can destroy the shackles (standard power hardness) or break free with a **Strength** or **Escape** test (standard action). They can also use effects not requiring foot mobility. Area attacks damaging the shackles reduce their hardness (see Barrier or p. 274).

**Evolutions**:

- **Shackle Level 8**: Duration becomes **sustained**.
- **Shackle Level 10**: Can target up to **3 creatures** within **5m** of each other. Using it twice on the same targets makes them **helpless**, fully shackled.
