The **Raiton** (Lightning Release) power allows a shinobi to manipulate electricity, offering a wide range of combat possibilities, from paralyzing effects to extensive damage comparable to purely battle-oriented styles. Raiton matches **Katon** in offensive potential but is primarily a short-to-medium-range style, favored by **Taijutsu** users.

**Raiton** follows the same rules as the **Ninpou** power but has limited access to effects due to electricity’s immaterial nature (e.g., it cannot use **Shackle** to create prisons). It has the **smallest area of effect** but offers the **highest range**, the **third-highest damage** among elements, and versatile applications.

- **Range**: Long (15m + 3m per Spirit level). You can only manipulate or create electricity up to the power’s maximum range.
- **Size**: Creations, manipulations, and areas of effect can have up to **0.5m of diameter, length, width, or height per Spirit level** (rounded up).
- **Additional Damage**: All Raiton effects gain **+1 base damage**.
- **Allowed Effects**: Cannon, Orb, Column, Arrows, Destructive Breath, Ray, Energize, Missile, Explosive Wave, Ricochet, Meteors (Katon-specific effect).
- **Exclusive Effects**: Listed below.

### EXCLUSIVE RAITON EFFECTS

#### LEVEL 2 EFFECT

**LIGHTNING BLADE**

- **Prerequisite**: Spirit 8
- **Action**: Movement
- **Range**: Touch
- **Damage**: See text
- **Duration**: Sustained (1 attack)

You concentrate a large amount of chakra in your hand, transform it into **Raiton**, and shape it into an electric discharge, producing a high-pitched chirping sound reminiscent of birds. Preparing the technique requires a **movement action**. Attacking requires touching the target (standard action, **Hand-to-Hand Combat (CC)** test) and deals **standard power damage**, ignoring **1 point of target hardness**.

This effect destroys any normal weapon used to block it, causing the defense to fail, even if under the **Energize** effect (except for **Fuuton** or **Raiton** Energize). You can sustain the technique but can only make **one attack** (successful or not). If you defeat a **minion** with it, you can sustain it for **one additional attack** ( repeatable for multiple minions).

For a **surprise attack** against a **flat-footed** target, the damage is at least **degree 2**. However, the target can make an **Alertness** test to notice the technique due to its noise, in addition to any other tests they’re entitled to.

**Evolutions**:

- **Lightning Blade Level 5**: Preparing the technique becomes a **partial action**. You can attack using the **Charge** maneuver for **+2 damage**, plus **+1 per additional power level**. However, this leaves you open to an **opportunistic attack** if the target successfully uses **Dodge** or **Anticipate**. This penalty is negated if you are **Accelerated** or have **Nidan Sharingan**. The **Mobility** feat can be used against this opportunistic attack.
- **Lightning Blade Level 7**: Ignores **all hardness** except from **Fuuton** protections, and only **half the hardness** of **Raiton** protections.
- **Lightning Blade Level 9**: Gains the **Improved Critical** feat’s benefits for this effect, stacking with the **Lightning Mastery** feat.

#### LEVEL 4 EFFECT

**ELECTRIC WEAPON**

- **Prerequisite**: Lightning Blade
- **Action**: Partial
- **Range**: Personal
- **Damage**: See text
- **Duration**: Sustained
- **Chakra Cost**: See text
- **Hand Seals**: No

This effect combines aspects of **Create Weapon** and **Energize** with restrictions:

- **Energize**: [Chakra Cost: 3] You can use the **Energize** effect, but only for slashing or piercing weapons.
- **Create Projectiles**: [Chakra Cost: 1] You create simple thrown weapons made of electricity, lasting until the start of your next turn after being thrown.
- **Create Blade**: [Chakra Cost: 4] You create a short sword blade (or another light sword) from your hand, dealing damage per the **Energize** effect and ignoring **1 point of target hardness**. You can extend it up to **5m** toward an enemy for an attack (standard action, **CC** or **CD** test, your choice). The blade returns to normal size after the attack, with no additional chakra cost for extension.

**Evolutions**:

- **Electric Weapon Level 8**: Any normal weapon blocking or blocked by this effect is destroyed unless under **Energize** (except **Doton** Energize), making your attack an **automatic success**.

#### LEVEL 6 EFFECT

**DISCHARGE**

- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Standard for the power or touch
- **Area of Effect**: Hemisphere or circle
- **Damage**: Half the standard power damage
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Chakra Cost**: Standard for the power

You create an electric current and discharge it around you, dealing **half the standard power damage**. If any damage is dealt, the target must pass a **Stamina test (standard difficulty -3)** or be **stunned** until the end of their next turn.

Alternatively, you can focus the current into a single projectile attack or discharge it during a melee attack with **Energize - Raiton** or **Electric Weapon: Energize** (if you have it). This increases the **Stamina test difficulty** by **+1**. This mode deals **half the standard power damage** (excluding Energize/Electric Weapon melee damage). If used via Energize, no hand seals are required.
