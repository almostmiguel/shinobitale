Through pure chakra control, you can deliver punches and kicks with superhuman strength, capable of creating craters or even killing a target in a single blow.

- **Prerequisite**: [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]] Level 6; [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Iryou Ninjutsu\|Iryou Ninjutsu]] Level 2  
- **Benefit**: You spend a **Move Action** to gather chakra in one of your hands or feet, maintaining it continuously. This preparation does not require hand seals. With a **Free Action**, you release the gathered chakra during a single unarmed attack to deal massive damage to the target (the chakra release occurs whether the attack hits or not).

	The attack deals damage equal to ½ [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]] + [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Iryou Ninjutsu\|Iryou Ninjutsu]] level. This damage replaces the standard damage calculation (i.e., [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] or weapon damage is not used). The chakra cost is equal to half your [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]].

	A target hit by this attack must pass an [[2. Mechanics/Skills/General/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] check (DC 9 + your [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]]) to avoid being knocked prone.

	The **Kyoudo Kyouka** attack cannot be blocked using the *Block* defense action with ordinary weapons or unarmed, but it can be blocked with a special weapon that explicitly allows such a defense in its description.

	If the chakra has already been concentrated, you can use the **Kyoudo Kyouka** unarmed attack in standard maneuvers, such as *Charge*, *Opportunity Attack*, or *Coup de Grâce*.

	As a close-combat attack technique, **Kyoudo Kyouka** can benefit from the [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Specialist\|Specialist]] (Unarmed) or [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Mastery\|Mastery]] feats, but never both simultaneously. No damage bonuses or weapon effects can be applied to **Kyoudo Kyouka**, nor can the [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Improved Critical\|Improved Critical]] or *Maneuver Feats* be used.

**Level 2**: When you reach [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]] Level 10, you can purchase this aptitude again to upgrade it. You can gather more chakra, preparing the technique with a **Move Action** (instead of a partial action) and increasing the damage to [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]] + [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Iryou Ninjutsu\|Iryou Ninjutsu]] level.

# Techniques

Below is a list of techniques accessible to all characters.

### OUKASHOU (CHERRY BLOSSOM IMPACT)

- **Taijutsu Rank**: C / Chakra Control
- **Prerequisites**: **Kyoudo Kyouka** Level 2; [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]] Level 10
- **Action**: Standard + action for chakra concentration
- **Range**: Touch
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Chakra Cost**: ½ [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]]

This technique involves a punch using chakra-enhanced strength, dealing the standard damage of **Kyoudo Kyouka** (which varies based on the action spent on chakra concentration). The technique lives up to its name when used to strike the ground. The impact completely shatters the ground, creating rocks shaped like cherry blossom petals.

When used against the ground, this technique creates a crater with a diameter of 1.5 meters per [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]] level. Those within the area of effect who fail their defensive action take half the standard **Kyoudo Kyouka** damage and are knocked *prone* unless they pass an [[2. Mechanics/Skills/General/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] check (DC 9 + your [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]]). If there is anyone underground, they take the full **Kyoudo Kyouka** damage with a *Damage Degree* of 4.

### TSUUTENKYAKU (CELESTIAL PAIN KICK)

- **Taijutsu Rank**: C / Chakra Control
- **Prerequisites**: **Kyoudo Kyouka** Level 2; [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]] Level 10
- **Action**: Standard + action for chakra concentration
- **Range**: Touch
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Chakra Cost**: ½ [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]]

This technique functions the same as **Oukashou** but is performed with a downward vertical kick, typically delivered after a jump.
