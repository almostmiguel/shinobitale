You can create an exact material replica of yourself, indistinguishable from the original to the naked eye.

- **Prerequisite**: [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]] Level 6  
- **Benefit**: A clone is a Partner. You can create up to 2 clones with a **Standard Action** and cannot have more clones active simultaneously beyond this number (even if they are different types of clones). Pay 1 Chakra Point per clone created. When created, the replica appears immediately beside the user.

- **Clone Type**: When purchasing this feat, choose the material your clone is made of. Common materials include vital energy (*Kage Bunshin*), water (*Mizu Bunshin*), and stone (*Iwa Bunshin*). Clones inherit the elemental advantage/disadvantage of their material (e.g., an Iwa Bunshin has a disadvantage against [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Raiton\|Raiton]]). Depending on the material, the clone may gain special characteristics. The chosen material must align with your character sheet and any additional requirements (e.g., Kage Bunshin is exclusive to Konoha). You can purchase this aptitude feat times to gain other clone types.

- **Distinguishing the Clone**: It is impossible to visually distinguish the clone from the character. However, enemies with [[Chakra Vision\|Chakra Vision]] or [[Kagura Shingan\|Kagura Shingan]] can always tell the difference, as they can identify jutsu. *Kage Bunshin* and *Moku Bunshin* are exceptions: because they possess vital energy, they cannot be differentiated by any ability.

- **Clone Stats**: The clone has the same stats as the user, can use the same weapons, and has the same accuracies, including benefits from [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Iron Fist\|Iron Fist]], [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Specialist\|Specialist]], [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Mastery\|Mastery]], [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Insight\|Insight]], [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Reflexes\|Reflexes]], and [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Finesse\|Finesse]], but takes a -3 penalty on all checks (this penalty does not count toward the accuracy penalty limit). Clones cannot use any of the user’s techniques or powers, nor any feats beyond those listed. They also cannot use or activate chakra-dependent items (e.g., explosive tags).

- **Attack Damage**: Armed and unarmed attacks made by the clone have the same base damage as if made by the user, respecting the Partner damage rules.

- **Hit Points and Chakra Points**: Clones have only 1 Hit Point and no Chakra Points. Clones made of different materials may have different Hit Points and Chakra Points (see below).

- **Mentality**: Each clone has its own mind, which is a copy of the user’s mind. The clones’ minds are not connected to each other or to the user, preventing any form of communication between them. A clone can be targeted by mind-control or mind-reading techniques, such as genjutsu or the [[2. Mechanics/Clans/Yamanaka\|Yamanaka]] clan’s Shinraishin. If a clone is affected by a mental effect, it does not affect other clones or the user.

- **Duration**: Continuous. You or the clone can end the technique with a **Free Action**. You cannot reuse the technique in the same turn a clone is dispelled.

- **Items**: Clones have the same items as the character, but they are fake replicas (i.e., they lack the benefits of the originals) with zero hardness and absorption equal to the clone’s Hit Points. Thus, copied explosives do not detonate, special weapon benefits cannot be used, seals cannot be activated, etc.

- **Combat**: Clones are considered Minions and follow these rules:

	- Minions cannot score critical hits against non-minions or use coup de grâce.
	- Non-minions can reroll one die on attack checks against minions (normally, you cannot reroll dice on attack checks). You must still roll two dice to determine the damage degree.
	- Minions do not gain attacks of opportunity against non-minions.

**Level 2**: When you reach [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]] Level 8, you can purchase this aptitude again to upgrade it. You can create and control up to 6 clones, but they automatically fail any [[2. Mechanics/Character Rules/5. - Combat Skills\|Combat Skill]] checks.


# Clone Examples

Below is a list of clone types accessible to all characters. Exclusive clones, such as *Moku Bunshin*, have their descriptions within their respective **clans** and **Hijutsu**.

### GENERIC CLONE

- **Ninjutsu Rank**: C
- **Prerequisites**: Clone
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Personal
- **Duration**: Continuous
- **Chakra Cost**: 1 per clone

You can use this **Generic Clone** whenever you choose not to select a specific clone type when purchasing the [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Shinobi Feats/Clone\|Clone]] feat. The material of the clone is your choice, including elements not commonly associated with clones or even [[(Hibon) Ninpou\|(Hibon) Ninpou]]. Select one of the following benefits for your clone:

- **Sharpshooter Clone**: Your [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Ranged Combat (RC)\|Ranged Combat (RC)]] and [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Dodge (DOD)\|Dodge (DOD)]] levels do not suffer the standard -3 accuracy penalty for clones, as long as you use only a single clone.
- **Resilient Clone**: Has a body hardness equal to the user’s [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]] level - 3.
- **Deceptive Clone**: [Requires [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Shinobi Feats/Deceptive Replica\|Deceptive Replica]]]. Once per scene, when targeted by an attack, you can swap places with a clone within 10m, provided there are no movement impediments or obstacles between you and the clone. Both you and the clone must have a **Move Action** available to perform the swap. This counts as a use of the [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Shinobi Feats/Deceptive Replica\|Deceptive Replica]] feat and follows the rules of the *Kawarimi no Jutsu* technique.

### IWA BUNSHIN (STONE CLONE)

- **Ninjutsu Rank**: C / Doton
- **Prerequisites**: [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Shinobi Feats/Clone\|Clone]]; [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Doton\|Doton]] Level 1
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Personal
- **Duration**: Continuous
- **Chakra Cost**: 1 per clone

You create a clone made of stone and chakra. Due to its stone composition, the clone has greater resilience, with Hit Points equal to 1/5 of the character’s Hit Points. Additionally, if you are under the effect of a supporting [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Doton\|Doton]] technique when creating the clone, it also benefits from that technique as long as the original character maintains it.

The **Iwa Bunshin** can merge with earth or rocks, as if using the *Submerge* Level 2 effect of the [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Doton\|Doton]] power (at no chakra cost, as this clone has no chakra reserve).

---

### KAGE BUNSHIN (SHADOW CLONE)

- **Ninjutsu Rank**: B / Kinjutsu
- **Prerequisites**: Clone
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Personal
- **Duration**: Continuous
- **Chakra Cost**: 0 (see text)

To create this clone, the user expends their own vital energy, paying 3 Hit Points per clone created and dividing their Chakra Points equally among themselves and the **Kage Bunshins** (if the division results in a fraction, the larger portion remains with the user). For example: with one clone, Chakra is divided by 2; with two clones, Chakra is divided by 3, and so on.

**Example**: Uzumaki Naruto has 20 Chakra and creates 3 **Kage Bunshins**. After paying 9 Hit Points, the clones are created, dividing the 20 Chakra points equally. Each clone and the user receive 5 Chakra (20 divided by four).

Since the clones are formed by dividing the character’s chakra, when a clone is dispelled, any remaining chakra instantly returns to the user, along with the clone’s experiences, making it an ideal spy.

Fatigue conditions ([[Fatigued\|Fatigued]] and [[Exhausted\|Exhausted]]) from clones also return to the user upon dispelling and are cumulative. For example, if two **Kage Bunshins** are [[Fatigued\|Fatigued]], the user becomes [[Exhausted\|Exhausted]] when they are dispelled. If three clones are [[Fatigued\|Fatigued]], the user falls unconscious.

While **Kage Bunshins** are active, the user’s natural chakra regeneration is suppressed. To create new **Kage Bunshins**, existing ones must be dispelled first.

**[Requires [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Shinobi Feats/True Clone\|True Clone]]]**: You can create and control a single **Shadow Clone** capable of using basic jutsu, powers, and aptitudes, provided they are not restricted. When a **Shadow Clone** uses a power or feat, the chakra cost is deducted from the clone’s chakra, and it dispels when its chakra reaches zero.

### MIZU BUNSHIN (WATER CLONE)

- **Ninjutsu Rank**: C / Suiton
- **Prerequisites**: Clone; Suiton 1
- **Action**: Standard
- **Range**: Personal
- **Duration**: Continuous
- **Chakra Cost**: 1 per clone

You create a clone made of water and chakra. Although it lacks your full strength, the clone is fully capable in close combat, and its [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Melee Combat (MC)\|Melee Combat (MC)]] and [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Dodge (DOD)\|Dodge (DOD)]] levels do not suffer the standard -3 accuracy penalty for clones, as long as you use only a single clone.

The **Mizu Bunshin** can serve as the origin point for ranged [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Suiton\|Suiton]] power attacks. To do so, the clone must be within 5m, you perform the hand seals, and the [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Suiton\|Suiton]] technique is cast from the clone, which temporarily dissolves its arms to execute the jutsu through them.

Even when using the **Mizu Bunshin** as the origin for a sustained or concentration-based technique, the original character must maintain the concentration or sustenance, expending their actions, while the clone remains immobile. If attacked in this state, the **Mizu Bunshin** is flat-footed. The sustained or concentration-based technique ends immediately if the clone is destroyed.

The **Mizu Bunshin** can merge with any body of water, as if using the *Submerge* Level 2 effect of the [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Doton\|Doton]] power (at no chakra cost, as this clone has no chakra reserve).
