You use chakra to alter the environment’s appearance and how it is perceived by others, deceiving those who observe it.

- **Prerequisite**: [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] Level 2  
- **Benefit**: You create an illusion at any point in the environment within 5 meters of you. The illusion cannot move from this point, but it can be static (e.g., an inanimate object) or animated (e.g., an animal moving in place without leaving its position). After creating the illusion, you can move away from it without worrying about the range limit.

	The effects of the illusion vary based on what the character creates. For example, during combat, creating an illusion of a cliff in front of an opponent may prevent them from advancing. Creating the illusion costs a **Standard Action** and 1 Chakra Point per size category.

- **Size**: The illusion’s size depends on your [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] level:

- **Small**: Available at [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] 2 (e.g., altering a door’s writing or making small objects appear/disappear).
- **Medium**: Available at [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] 8.
- **Large**: Available at [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] 12.
- **Huge**: Available at [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] 16.

- **Interacting with an Illusion**: A person who physically interacts with the modified object (e.g., by touching it) will realize it is an illusion. Recognizing the illusion does not immediately dispel it, but once its existence is known, a person can dispel it using the Kai technique without requiring a check. Individuals with *Chakra Vision* automatically identify illusions without needing a check.

- **Duration**: Illusions are continuous if immobile or sustained if animated. You can cancel your illusion with a **Free Action**.
