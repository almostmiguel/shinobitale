You create an elemental or other type of clone and swap places with it before suffering an attack.

- **Prerequisite**: [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Suiton\|Suiton]] or [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Doton\|Doton]] Level 4, or [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Shinobi Feats/Clone\|Clone]] and [[2. Mechanics/Skills/General/Sleight of Hand\|Sleight of Hand]] Level 10  
- **Benefit**: You can use this aptitude when targeted by a melee or projectile attack and fail your defensive reaction by up to 2 points. By spending 4 Chakra Points, you create a clone to take the attack in your place and use your *Move Action* to move away, without provoking an attack of opportunity during this movement. You do not need to pay the clone’s creation cost when using this aptitude, and the clone is destroyed immediately after taking the attack.

	This aptitude can only be used once per scene and cannot be used after failing a defensive technique. With the **Game Master’s permission**, you can use your [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Ninpou\|Ninpou]] (or [[2. Mechanics/Hijutsus/Hibon Ninpou\|Hibon Ninpou]]) level as a prerequisite instead of [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Suiton\|Suiton]]/[[2. Mechanics/Powers/Doton\|Doton]], if the Ninou concept allows.

**Level 2**: When you reach [[2. Mechanics/Skills/General/Sleight of Hand\|Sleight of Hand]] Level 12, you can purchase this feat again to upgrade it. You can use the feat up to 2 times per scene. After evading the attack, you gain the right to make a [[2. Mechanics/Skills/General/Stealth\|Stealth]] check to hide as part of your movement (which is reduced by half per [[2. Mechanics/Skills/General/Stealth\|Stealth]] rules).
