The character can locate creatures through their chakra.

- **Prerequisite**: [[2. Mechanics/Skills/General/Track\|Track]] Level 10  
- **Benefit**: Your character can track creatures with chakra within a range of 10 meters + 2 meters per [[2. Mechanics/Skills/General/Track\|Track]] level. The character cannot distinguish chakra signatures or measure their quantity with this aptitude but will know the exact location of each creature.

Using this feat costs 5 Chakra Points, requires a *Move Action*, and its effect lasts only until the start of your next turn. To maintain the sensor for longer, using it requires a *Standard Action* and sustaining it requires concentration.

**Limited Sensor**: Optionally, when purchasing this aptitude, you can choose one of the following limitations for your sensor. A limited sensor has a reduced chakra cost of 3 points.

- **Ground Detection**: You must touch the ground with your hand to use the sensor, and only creatures in contact with the ground are detected.
- **Scent**: You detect creatures by their scent, not their chakra. Detecting scents always requires a [[2. Mechanics/Skills/General/Track\|Track]] check (DC 20). The DC increases to 30 if conditions hinder detection, such as wind, rain, or strong competing odors. For creatures with a natural and continuous scent-based sensor (e.g., dogs), the DCs are reduced by 3, and the check is made as a reaction to each new scent that appears after the sensor is activated.
