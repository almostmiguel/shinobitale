**Prerequisite**: [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] or [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] Level 10, [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Diligent\|Diligent]], [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Sprinter\|Sprinter]]  
**Benefit**: The character maximizes their proficiency in the basic **Shunshin no Jutsu** technique to use it in combat. Using **Shunjutsu** is a *Free Action* performed during your normal movement or defense and costs 1 Chakra Point.

The character can use **Shunjutsu** for movement, substituting the [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]] attribute for [[2. Mechanics/Character Rules/4. - Attributes\|4. - Attributes]] or [[2. Mechanics/Character Rules/6. - Skills\|6. - Skills]] in calculating distance and any movement maneuver checks (e.g., *Run* or the *Charge* maneuver).

**Shunjutsu** allows one additional use of the *Kawarimi no Jutsu* technique per scene.

**Level 2**: When you reach [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] or [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] Level 12, you can purchase this feat again to upgrade it. You can *Feint* using [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] or [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] instead of [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]].

**Level 3**: When you reach [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] or [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] Level 16, you can purchase this aptitude again to upgrade it. You are considered hastened while moving with **Shunjutsu**. Using it during defense negates an opponentâ€™s hastened feint.
