You can create illusions that directly affect the target’s mind.

- **Prerequisite**: [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] Level 4  
- **Benefit**: With a **Standard Action** and 3 Chakra Points, you trap a single target in a mental illusion of your choice. The target must be within 5 meters. You do not make a check, but the target must make an [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] check (DC 6 + your [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]]). If they fail, they become fascinated for the remainder of the scene.

- **Noticing Genjutsu**: Starting from the second round under the illusion’s effect, once before acting, the victim may repeat the [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] check as a **Free Action** with a -1 penalty to the DC, which stacks with each new attempt. If successful, they break free from the fascination. The fascination also ends if the victim takes any amount of damage.

A target cannot be fascinated multiple times in the same scene by this feat.
