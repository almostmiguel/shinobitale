You are not a genius, know no secret techniques, or belong to a clan, but you train every day to match the great ninjas.

- **Prerequisite**: Must not have a [[2. Mechanics/Character Rules/3. - Clans, Kekkei Genkai, and Hijutsu\|Clan]] or Hijutsu
- **Benefit**: Each turn, you can choose one of the following bonuses and gain it until the start of your next turn. These bonuses apply to any type of attack or defense and stack with bonuses from other feats:

	- +5 meters to movement speed
	- +1 accuracy on attack checks
	- +1 accuracy on defense checks
	- +1 to base attack damage
	- +1 to the resistance Difficulty Class (DC) of your techniques

- **Swapping the Feat**: If you later acquire a Clan or Hijutsu power or feat, you must replace Hard Work with another non-restricted feat.

- **Special - Weighted Training**: You can purchase and keep this feat on your character sheet alongside the Hachimon Tonkou Hijutsu (page 202). However, you can only choose one of the first three bonuses (movement, attack accuracy, defense accuracy), and you cannot gain the benefits of this feat and Hachimon Tonkou simultaneously.
