Your clones are nearly perfect replicas capable of using jutsu.

- **Prerequisite**: [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]] Level 10; [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Shinobi Feats/Clone\|Clone]] (*Kage Bunshin* or *Moku Bunshin*)  
- **Benefit**: You can create and control a single clone that can use powers, aptitudes, and basic jutsu. The Difficulty Class (DC) for resistance checks against the cloneâ€™s jutsu and powers is reduced by -3. If the clone uses a technique with a limited number of uses (e.g., *Kawarimi*), it counts as a use for the original character. The **True Clone** can also use or activate chakra-dependent items (e.g., explosive tags).

The **True Clone** cannot use restricted powers or feats (even those purchased normally, such as [[Hachimon\|Hachimon]] Level 1), with the exception of *Moku Bunshin*, which can use the [[Mokuton\|Mokuton]] power. It also cannot execute or maintain sustained or concentration-based techniques.

You cannot create or maintain other clones while a **True Clone** is active. All other rules and penalties from the [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Shinobi Feats/Clone\|Clone]] feat still apply.
