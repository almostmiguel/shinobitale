You can chain quick successive strikes after completing a combo.

- **Prerequisite:** [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] Level 14 **or** [[Hachimon Tonkou\|Hachimon Tonkou]] Level 6, **and** [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Maneuver Feats/Multiattack\|Multiattack]]
    
- **Benefit:**  
    This aptitude must be used in conjunction with [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Maneuver Feats/Multiattack\|Multiattack]] and cannot be combined with any other maneuver aptitude besides this one.  
    If your **final strike** in the [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Maneuver Feats/Multiattack\|Multiattack]] sequence hits successfully, you roll **two additional attacks** against the same target (the target does **not** re-roll defenses; use the last defense roll made).  
    For each of these extra hits, add **+1 bonus damage** to your last attack.
    
    These bonuses stack with [[Hachimon Tonkou\|Hachimon Tonkou]] if acquired through the [[Lotus Style\|Lotus Style]] restricted feat.  
    If you have [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] Level 16 or [[Hachimon Tonkou\|Hachimon Tonkou]] Level 7, you may roll **one more extra attack** (for a total of 3 extra attacks).
