You can catch projectiles thrown at you mid-air, such as arrows, bolts, and thrown weapons.

- **Benefit:**  
    When you **block a projectile**, you may **catch the weapon instead of just deflecting it**.  
    Thrown weapons you catch can be **thrown back at the attacker as a free action**.  
    You also gain the ability to use the **Deflect Projectile** maneuver as a **reaction to defend**, provided you are not under any condition that prevents you from attacking.
