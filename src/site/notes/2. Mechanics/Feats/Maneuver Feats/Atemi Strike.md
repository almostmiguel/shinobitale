You are especially skilled at hitting vital points.

- **Prerequisites:** [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Maneuver Feats/Powerful Strike\|Powerful Strike]], [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Improved Critical\|Improved Critical]]
    
- **Benefit:** When attacking, you target a vital point of the opponent, suffering -1 to your attack roll but gaining +2 bonus damage on your unarmed attack.
    
- You also receive this damage bonus if you score a critical hit when attacking without any maneuver feat.
    
- You do not receive the bonus if the opponentâ€™s vital points are protected (for example, if they are wearing full armor).
