You know how to strike vulnerable spots to stun your foes.

- **Prerequisite:** [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] Level 12
    
- **Benefit:**  
    As a **standard action**, make a melee attack that deals **no damage**.  
    If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a **[[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Vigor\|Vigor]] save** (Difficulty Class = 7 + your [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] score) or be **stunned until the end of your next turn**.  
    You may apply any [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] bonus you have to increase the save DC, up to a maximum of +2.
