You strike while grabbing your opponentâ€™s defensive arm, removing it from the way to then deliver a punch with your free hand.

- **Prerequisite:** _[[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Brawler\|Brawler]]_
    
- **Benefit:** Your opponent cannot defend using the Block reaction when you attack unarmed. You can only use this feat if the target is also unarmed or wielding a light weapon.
