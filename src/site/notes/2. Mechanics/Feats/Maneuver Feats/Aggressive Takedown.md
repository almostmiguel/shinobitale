You strike with precision and force when knocking down your opponent.

- **Prerequisite:** _[[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Brawler\|Brawler]]_ or _[[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Warrior\|Warrior]]_
    
- **Benefit:**  
    When you use the **Takedown** maneuver, you may choose to deal damage **and** knock the target down.  
    The target is allowed a **[[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Vigor\|Vigor]] saving throw** (DC = 2 + your [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Melee Combat (MC)\|Melee Combat (MC)]] skill) to remain standing.  
    You can combine this feat with **[[2. Mechanics/Feats/Maneuver Feats/Throw\|Throw]]** â€” in that case, the target is only thrown if it fails the [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Vigor\|Vigor]] save against **Aggressive Takedown**.
