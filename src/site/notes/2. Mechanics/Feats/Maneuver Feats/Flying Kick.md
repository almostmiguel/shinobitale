You run and launch yourself at the enemy with one foot in the air, aiming to hit their head or torso.

- **Prerequisites:** _[[2. Mechanics/Feats/Maneuver Feats/Aggressive Takedown\|Aggressive Takedown]]_, _[[2. Mechanics/Feats/Maneuver Feats/Powerful Strike\|Powerful Strike]]_
    
- **Benefit:** You perform a **Charge** and at the end make an unarmed attack using the [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Maneuver Feats/Aggressive Takedown\|Aggressive Takedown]] feat.  
    In the attack, you suffer -1 to accuracy but gain +2 bonus damage, and the target suffers +3 levels of difficulty on the saving throw to avoid being knocked down.  
    The bonuses from the **Charge** maneuver are not applied, but the penalties still are.
