You chase your opponent to attack them again after throwing them.

- **Prerequisites:** _[[2. Mechanics/Feats/Maneuver Feats/Throw\|Throw]]_, _[[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Mobile Assault\|Mobile Assault]]_
    
- **Benefit:** After successfully using the [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Maneuver Feats/Throw\|Throw]] feat, you can move up to the thrown opponent using only a partial action and receive an extra standard action to make a new attack. The extra attack cannot be used with maneuver feats, except for [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Maneuver Feats/Multiattack\|Multiattack]] and [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Maneuver Feats/Progressive Attack\|Progressive Attack]]. The movement granted by this feat does not count toward your movement limit.
    

The airborne target has limited defenses: they cannot use the **Evade** maneuver or any defense that requires movement; and are considered unprepared if defending using [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Dodge (DOD)\|Dodge (DOD)]] or [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Anticipate Movement (AM)\|Anticipate Movement (AM)]]. They can defend using a technique as long as it can be used fully airborne and against melee attacks.

If the extra attack hits successfully, the target is thrown downward, falling prone and taking fall damage that cannot be reduced by [[2. Mechanics/Skills/General/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]. You land on the ground at the end of the turn.

You cannot use this feat if the [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Maneuver Feats/Throw\|Throw]] was executed together with [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Maneuver Feats/Multiattack\|Multiattack]] or [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Maneuver Feats/Aggressive Takedown\|Aggressive Takedown]].
