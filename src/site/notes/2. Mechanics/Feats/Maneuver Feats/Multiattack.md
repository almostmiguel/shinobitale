You can strike multiple times when armed or unarmed, splitting your damage among your attacks.

- **Prerequisite:** [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Melee Combat (MC)\|Melee Combat (MC)]] or [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Ranged Combat (RC)\|Ranged Combat (RC)]] Level 11
    
- **Benefit:**  
    You may make **two or three attacks** using the same standard action, dividing your total base damage equally among the attacks.  
    If the damage division is uneven, assign the extra damage to the first attacks.  
    For example, if your melee attack would deal 10 base damage (before applying damage grades), you could split it into two attacks dealing 5 damage each, or three attacks dealing 4, 3, and 3 damage.  
    Any damage bonuses or reductions (including hardness) are applied **before** splitting the damage.
    
- **Additional Rules:**
    
    - You must roll to hit for **each attack**, and your target may use a **reaction defense for each one**.
        
    - Defensive feats, techniques like _Kawarimi_, or defenses that are **not reactions** only apply against the **first attack**.
        
    - Damage grades, critical hits, and critical failures are determined **individually** for each attack.
        
    - You may use special maneuvers on any of the divided attacks (e.g., disarm on the first attack, normal attack on the rest).
        
    - You can use **one maneuver feat** on one of the attacks but never more than one per round (e.g., [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Maneuver Feats/Powerful Strike\|Powerful Strike]] on the first attack, normal attacks thereafter).
        
    - If you have the **[[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Mobile Assault\|Mobile Assault]]** feat, you can move between attacks but no more than twice per round.
        
    - If the target has any detrimental conditions (e.g., feinted or flat-footed), the penalty applies to **all attacks**.
        
    - Likewise, any accuracy bonuses or penalties apply to all attacks.
        
    - You cannot use **Multiattack** if the maneuver, power, or feat requires a **single attack** (e.g., the Charge maneuver).
