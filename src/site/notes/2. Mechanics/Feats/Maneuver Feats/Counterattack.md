You are skilled at striking back when an enemyâ€™s melee attack fails.

- **Prerequisite:** [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Melee Combat (MC)\|Melee Combat (MC)]] 12
    
- **Benefit:**  
    When you successfully block a melee attack (Strike maneuver) from an opponent, and your block result exceeds theirs by 4 or more, you may make an immediate **opportunity attack** against them.  
    If you score a critical success on the block, or if the enemy critically fails their attack, your opportunity attack automatically **hits** (automatic success).
