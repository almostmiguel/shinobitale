Your character has honed their skills in manipulating devices and mechanical and technological arts.

- **Benefit**: You can create traps and mechanical devices using [[2. Mechanics/Skills/General/Mechanisms\|Mechanisms]]. This feat also allows you to use mechanisms within the [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Ninpou\|Ninpou]] power. For example, you could create a grenade that explodes with the *Column* effect. In this case, [[2. Mechanics/Skills/General/Mechanisms\|Mechanisms]] replaces [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]] for [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Ninpou\|Ninpou]] parameters, and you can also use these effects as traps, following the rules for **Ninjutsu no Wana**.
	
- **Normal**: Characters without this feat cannot create traps or devices but can disarm them with a [[2. Mechanics/Skills/General/Mechanisms\|Mechanisms]] check.
