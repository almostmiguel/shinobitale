You are especially resilient to certain types of dangers.

**Benefit**: Choose an [[2. Mechanics/Character Rules/4. - Attributes\|Attribute]]. You can reroll a resistance check for that [[2. Mechanics/Character Rules/4. - Attributes\|Attribute]] that you have just made. You must accept the second roll, even if it is worse than the first. You cannot use this feat if you suffered a critical failure on the first check.
