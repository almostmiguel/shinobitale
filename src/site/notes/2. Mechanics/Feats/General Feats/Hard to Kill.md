You withstand injuries that would fell others.

- **Benefit**: When you are attacked and take damage that would reduce you to 0 or fewer Hit Points, you can ignore part of the damage to stay in combat. You retain Hit Points equal to your [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Vigor\|Vigor]] level, or 1 point if your Hit Points are already very low. You can use this feat once per day. This feat does not work against critical hits.
