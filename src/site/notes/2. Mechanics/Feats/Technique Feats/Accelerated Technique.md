You can perform techniques more quickly.

- **Prerequisite**: [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]] or [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] Level 12  
- **Benefit**: You can execute a technique that normally requires a **Standard Action** as a **Move Action**. Techniques that cause damage or chakra loss cannot be accelerated (if a technique has other effects besides damage, you can reduce the damage to zero and apply only the other effects to accelerate it). Touch-based techniques cannot have their execution accelerated, but their preparation can.

This aptitude can only be used on your own turn and does not affect defensive techniques. Techniques with an execution time equal to or greater than a **Full Action** are also unaffected.

Accelerated Technique affects only the execution of the technique, not its duration. For example, executing a concentration technique as a **Move Action** still requires spending a **Standard Action** on subsequent turns to maintain concentration.
