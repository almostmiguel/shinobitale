You know how to use ambient water or the remnants of your techniques to increase the power of your attacks.

- **Prerequisite:** [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Suiton\|Suiton]] Level 5
    
- **Benefit:** When attacking with an area effect from the [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Suiton\|Suiton]] power, a number of water points accumulate in the environment equal to the level of the effect used.  
   You can increase the damage of new attacks by +1 by spending a number of water points equal to the level of the conjured effect (which does not need to be an area attack).  
   
The **Water Mastery** bonus is not cumulative: you receive it only once per action.  
If the environment has natural water, like seas or rivers, you always receive the damage bonus.  

An effect improved by this aptitude does not generate new water points in the environment, but you can accumulate more points by using techniques normally.

Water points are only generated when the technique is executed. If the technique is continuous, sustained, or maintained by concentration, it does not generate new water points after the initial execution. However, the damage bonus granted by **Water Mastery** remains for the entire duration of the technique.
