Your flames produce nearly unbearable heat.

- **Prerequisite**: [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Katon\|Katon]] Level 5  
	
- **Benefit**: Whenever you use an area-of-effect [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Katon\|Katon]] technique, whether it hits its targets or not, creatures in the area must make a [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Vigor\|Vigor]] check (DC 7 + 2 Ã— Effect Level used) to avoid becoming debilitated for 1 round due to the heat and oxygen burn. In enclosed environments, the [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Vigor\|Vigor]] check DC increases by +2.

**Fire Mastery** cannot be applied if the attack is countered with a [[2. Mechanics/Powers/Suiton\|Suiton]] technique or blocked.
