You can make it harder for your enemies to resist your techniques.

- **Prerequisite**: [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] Level 6  
	
- **Benefit**: You increase the Difficulty Class (DC) of Skill checks used to resist or escape one of your techniques by +2 (e.g., [[2. Mechanics/Skills/General/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] checks to avoid being knocked down by a techniqueâ€™s effect).
