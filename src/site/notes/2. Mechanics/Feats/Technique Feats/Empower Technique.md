*[Can utilize META enhancement]*

You can amplify the effects of your techniques.

- **Prerequisite**: [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]] or [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] Level 8  
- **Benefit**: When using a technique, you can apply one of the following enhancements:
	1. Double the diameter, width, and/or length of the area of effect.
	2. Double the range (for a ranged technique with a DC-based check).
	3. Increase the base damage by +1.

You can only apply an enhancement if the relevant parameter exists in the technique. For example, to double the diameter of an area of effect, the technique must have an area with a diameter to double.
