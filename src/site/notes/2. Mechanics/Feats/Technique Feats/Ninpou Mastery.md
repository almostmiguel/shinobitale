Your ninja art projectiles are swift and difficult to evade.

- **Prerequisite**: **Ninpou** or **Hibon Ninpou** Level 5, [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Blind Spot\|Blind Spot]]
	
- **Benefit**: When you use the **Feint** maneuver with the *Arrows* effect of your **Ninpou** or **Hibon Ninpou** power, you must declare that you will follow up with the same *Arrows* effect to gain this benefit: your Feint costs only a **Move Action**. Unless stated otherwise, this aptitude cannot be used with modified versions of **Ninpou** (such as the [[Aburame\|Aburame]] clanâ€™s **Kikai Ninpou**).
