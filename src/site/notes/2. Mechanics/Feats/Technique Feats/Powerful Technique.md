Your techniques deal additional damage.

- **Prerequisite**: [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Spirit\|Spirit]] or [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] Level 12  
	
- **Benefit**: Increase the Damage Degree of your technique by +0.5. For example, if a Lightning technique achieves a Damage Degree of 2, it increases to 2.5. After multiplying the base damage by the new Damage Degree, if the final value is a decimal, round it up.
