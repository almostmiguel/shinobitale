You are particularly skilled at performing hand seals at high speed.

- **Prerequisites:**  
    _[[2. Mechanics/Skills/General/Sleight of Hand\|Sleight of Hand]]_ Level 12, _[[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Blind Spot\|Blind Spot]]_
    
- **Benefit:**  
    You gain the benefits of the **Specialist** and **Innate Skill** feats on your _Sleight of Hand_ checks when feinting using techniques.
    
    If your _Sleight of Hand_ skill is **14 or higher**, you may perform hand seals using only **one hand**. This is useful if you cannot use both hands due to being occupied or even amputated.
    
- **One-Handed Seal Casting:**  
    To perform hand seals one-handed, make a _Sleight of Hand_ check (Difficulty = 9 + 2 × power level).
    
    - **On failure:** your seals take longer than normal, requiring an additional **move action** beyond the actions normally needed for the technique.
        
    - **On critical failure:** you cannot perform that technique during the turn.
        
- **Ranged Techniques:**  
    Instead of rolling the _Sleight of Hand_ check, you may choose to accept a **–3 penalty on your Ranged Combat check**.  
    You **cannot** use this option if you already have other accuracy penalties.
