You can follow up a successful melee kill with an additional strike.

- **Prerequisite:** [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Melee Combat (MC)\|Melee Combat (MC)]] Level 7
    
- **Benefit:**  
    In melee combat, when you deal enough damage to **defeat an opponent** (usually reducing their hit points to 0 or less), you may make **one extra melee attack** against a different creature within melee range.  
    You can use this ability **once per round** and only on your own turn.
    
- **Level 2 (Evolution):**  
    Upon reaching [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Melee Combat (MC)\|Melee Combat (MC)]] Level 9, you may purchase this feat again to evolve it.  
    At this level, you can use **Follow-Up Strike any number of times per round**.
