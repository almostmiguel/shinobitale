You are quick to react and strike repeatedly against foes who lower their guard.

- **Benefit:**  
    You can make additional opportunity attacks equal to **half your [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] score** (rounded down), but only **one opportunity attack per different enemy**.  
    For example, a character with [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] Level 5 can make a total of **3 opportunity attacks per round**â€”one normal and two extra thanks to this feat.  
    If four enemies enter your threatened area, you can strike opportunity attacks against three of them.
    
    Additionally, you can make opportunity attacks **even while flat-footed**.
    
- **Normal:**  
    Without this feat, a character can only make **one opportunity attack per round** and **cannot** make opportunity attacks while flat-footed.
