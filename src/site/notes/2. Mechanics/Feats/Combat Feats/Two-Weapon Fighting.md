You are trained in wielding a weapon in each hand with speed and coordination.

- **Prerequisite:** [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Melee Combat (MC)\|Melee Combat (MC)]] Level 12
    
- **Benefit:**  
    You can make attacks using:
    
    - **Double weapons** (e.g., Bo Staff),
        
    - **Paired weapons** (e.g., Sai, Tonfa),
        
    - Or **two light weapons**, one in each hand.
        
    
    You may also use this feat with any weapon that explicitly states compatibility with [[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Two-Weapon Fighting\|Two-Weapon Fighting]].
    
    When you make an attack using this feat, you **add the damage of both weapons together** into a single damage calculation.
    
- **Restrictions:**
    
    - Only works with **wielded weapons** (natural attacks and unarmed strikes are not eligible).
        
    - If you're using **two different weapons**, they must:
        
        - Use the **same attribute for damage calculation** (e.g., Strength or Dexterity),
            
        - Have the **same critical hit range**,
            
        - And you must have **equal accuracy** (hit bonus) with both.
            
- **Disarm Rule:**  
    If you're targeted by a **Disarm** maneuver, only **one weapon** can be disarmed. The attacker chooses which.
    
- **Normal:**  
    Without this feat, you **cannot attack with two weapons simultaneously**.
