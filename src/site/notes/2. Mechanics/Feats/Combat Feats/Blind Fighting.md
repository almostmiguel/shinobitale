You have enhanced ability to strike targets you cannot see.

- **Benefit:**  
    When you are in conditions of environmental concealment (such as smoke, fog, natural or magical) or impaired vision (darkness, blindness), you:
    
    - **Are not considered flat-footed** or otherwise caught off guard against unseen enemies.
        
    - Whenever you miss an attack due to concealment, you may **roll again** to determine if the attack actually hits.
        
- **Normal:**  
    Characters without this feat are considered flat-footed against unseen enemies.
    
- **Level 2 (Evolution):**  
    Upon reaching [[2. Mechanics/Skills/General/Notice\|Notice]] Level 12, you may purchase this feat again to evolve it.  
    You can fight an enemy **without needing to maintain direct eye contact** with them.
