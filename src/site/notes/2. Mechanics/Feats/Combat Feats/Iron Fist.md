You are a master of unarmed combat.

- **Prerequisite:** [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] Level 2
    
- **Benefit:**  
    When attacking unarmed, you can choose to deal either **lethal or non-lethal damage** and deal **1 weapon damage**.  
    This weapon damage **increases automatically based on your base [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] score** (ignoring bonuses):
    
    - [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] Level 8: 2 weapon damage
        
    - [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] Level 10: 3 weapon damage
        
    - [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] Level 12 or higher: 4 weapon damage (maximum)
        
- **Restrictions:**  
    Iron Fist **does not affect unarmed attacks that already have their own weapon damage**, such as the _Juuken_ power or the _Beastâ€™s Strength_ power from a Jinchuuriki.
