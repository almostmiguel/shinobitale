You know how to distract your opponents in combat.

- **Prerequisite:** _[[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]]_ Level 6 or _[[2. Mechanics/Skills/General/Sleight of Hand\|Sleight of Hand]]_ Level 6
    
- **Benefit:**  
    Through speed or tactics, you excel at striking where enemies least expect.  
    You can perform a **Feint** as a **move action** instead of a standard action.  
    This benefit also applies to powers and techniques that allow special feints, such as the _Arrow_ effect and _Bunshin no Jutsu_.
    
- **Normal:**  
    Without this feat, feinting in combat requires a standard action.
