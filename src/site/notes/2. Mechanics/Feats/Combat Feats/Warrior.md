You specialize in fighting with heavy or long weapons.

- **Prerequisite:** [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] or [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] Level 10
    
- **Benefit:**  
    Choose one weapon category: **Long Weapons** or **Heavy Weapons**.  
    While wielding a melee weapon from the chosen category, you can perform special combat maneuvers using your regular accuracy with that weapon, **without the usual â€“2 penalty** on the check (except for grapple maneuvers, which require free hands).
