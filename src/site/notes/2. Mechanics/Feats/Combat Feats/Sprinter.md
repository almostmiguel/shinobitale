You are exceptionally fast.

- **Benefit:**  
    When unarmored or wearing light armor, you **double your [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] score to calculate your movement speed**.  
    When you are **Hasted** or **Super Hasted**, instead of doubling, you gain a flat **+10 meters to your movement speed**.
