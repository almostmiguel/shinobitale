You know how to land deadly, precise strikes.

- **Prerequisites:** _[[2. Mechanics/Feats/Combat Feats/Specialist\|Specialist]]_, and [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Melee Combat (MC)\|Melee Combat (MC)]] or [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Ranged Combat (RC)\|Ranged Combat (RC)]] Level 13
    
- **Benefit:**  
    Choose either **unarmed attacks** or a specific **weapon**.  
    When attacking with the chosen method—using the basic _Strike_ maneuver or a maneuver feat—you score a critical hit on a **die roll 1 point lower than normal**.  
    For example, if the weapon’s critical range is 14–16, it becomes 13–16.
    
- **Restrictions:**  
    This feat **does not stack** with any other bonuses that similarly expand critical threat ranges.
