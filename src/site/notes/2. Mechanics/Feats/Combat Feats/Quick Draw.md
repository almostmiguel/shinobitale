You can draw your weapons with astonishing speed.

- **Benefit:**
    
    - You may **draw or sheath a weapon (or ammunition) as a free action**.
        
    - You can also **draw your melee weapon as part of a Block reaction**.
        
    - Additionally, you can **reload a light crossbow with a partial action** or a heavy crossbow with a **move action**.
        
- **Normal:**  
    Without this feat, drawing or sheathing a weapon requires a **partial action**.
    
- **Special:**  
    When executing a technique, if the only thing preventing you from performing hand seals is holding a weapon, you may perform the seals with one hand.  
    (Effectively, this works as if you sheath the weapon, perform the seals normally, and then draw the weapon again as a reaction.)
