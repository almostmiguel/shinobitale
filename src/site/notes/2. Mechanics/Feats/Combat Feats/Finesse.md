You are especially agile with light weapons that rely more on speed and precision than brute strength.

- **Prerequisite:** _[[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]]_ Level 3
    
- **Benefit:** You can use your **[[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]]** modifier to determine your **[[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Melee Combat (MC)\|Melee Combat (MC)]] Level**, instead of [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]]. Your [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Melee Combat (MC)\|Melee Combat (MC)]] Level becomes:  
    **Base Value + Dexterity**
    
- **Attacks:**  
    This feat applies **only** to:
    
    - **Unarmed strikes**
        
    - **Touch-range techniques**
        
    - **Light weapons**, and any weapon whose description states that this feat applies
        
    - **Thrown weapons** that can be used in melee (e.g., kunai)
        
- **Damage:**  
    This feat **does not** change how damage is calculatedâ€”[[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]] still applies to damage unless otherwise noted.
    
- **Blocking:**  
    You may use your [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]]-based [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Melee Combat (MC)\|Melee Combat (MC)]] Level when making **Block** reactions, but only with qualifying weapons or while unarmed.
    
- **Prerequisite Interactions:**  
    You may use your **[[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]]-based [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Melee Combat (MC)\|Melee Combat (MC)]] Level** (with Finesse) to meet **feat or power prerequisites**, as long as those features are **compatible with Finesse** (e.g., cannot use it to qualify for feats that require heavy weapons or [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Strength\|Strength]]-based combat).
