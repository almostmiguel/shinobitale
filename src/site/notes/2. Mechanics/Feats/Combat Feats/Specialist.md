- **Benefit:**  
    You specialize in the use of a particular weapon type or unarmed combat.
    
    Choose one category from the following:
    
    - Unarmed Combat
        
    - Natural Weapons
        
    - Ranged Weapons
        
    - Thrown Weapons
        
    - Light Weapons
        
    - Medium Weapons
        
    - Long Weapons
        
    - Heavy Weapons
        
    - Special Weapons
        
    
    You gain a **+1 bonus to attack rolls** ([[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Melee Combat (MC)\|Melee Combat (MC)]] or [[2. Mechanics/Skills/Combat/Ranged Combat (RC)\|Ranged Combat (RC)]] checks) with weapons in the chosen category.  
    If a weapon can be used both in melee and ranged combat (like a kunai), this bonus applies in both cases.
    
    If you choose unarmed combat, the bonus applies to both unarmed attacks and touch-range techniques.
    
- **Restrictions:**  
    The benefits of this feat **do not stack with Mastery** under any circumstances.
