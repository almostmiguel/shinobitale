You’ve trained to strike while in motion, weaving in and out of combat with speed and precision.

- **Prerequisite:** [[2. Mechanics/Attributes/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] Level 4
    
- **Benefit:**  
    You can **split your movement** into two parts, moving **before and after** making an attack (melee, ranged, or technique), as long as the **total distance moved does not exceed your maximum movement speed**.
    
- **Special Rules:**
    
    - You **cannot move backwards** as part of this split movement.
        
    - If you **approach an enemy, attack, and then continue moving**, you **do not provoke opportunity attacks**—you are considered to have attacked while running past them.
        
    - If you have the **[[2. Mechanics/Feats/Maneuver Feats/Multiattack\|Multiattack]]** feat, you may move **between attacks**, but you **may not move more than twice** in a single round.
        
    - This feat **cannot be used with a Charge maneuver**.
        
    - To make a **melee attack** using this feat, your target must be **at least 1 meter away** when you begin your movement.
