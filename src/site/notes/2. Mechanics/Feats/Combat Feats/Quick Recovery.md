You rise to your feet faster than most.

- **Benefit:**  
    You can stand up from prone using a **free action** on your turn instead of a move action.  
    Additionally, **once per scene**, you may use this feat as a **reaction** immediately after being knocked down by an opponent to stand up right away.
